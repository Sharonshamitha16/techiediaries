In this tutorial i'm going to show you how to build a website almost for free with just the cost of a domain name which can go down to around 1$,if you take benefit of the Godaddy offer,or up to around 12$ without any offer if you happen to have used that offer before (eligible only for your first .com domain) or if you want to buy your domain name from another provider.The hosting is totally free (0$) and i'm not talking about those low quality hosting plans/servers but a very good quality hosting using GitHub/GitLab servers so you'll have your website hosted on the same infrastructure used by these high traffic and powerful servers.I'll show also how to :

Get a professional email hosting for free .

Get an HTTPS certificate for free.

Get a subscriber mailing list for your website for free.

Send browser/push notifications to your visitors for free .

Add a contact form/general form to your website also for free. 

How to use other services like Prose.io to write and publish your content if you don't prefer to use the terminal and Git commands


But first you need to know one thing before we start ,the website is static which means you only have HTML,CSS and JavaScript ,no PHP or Python or any server side language.So if you are building a presentation,portfolio website and even a full featured blog or any thing like that for your needs or your company ,it is totally convenient for you and even better that dynamic websites but if you need anything more than that which requires specifc server technologies/languages(which means you really need a web application not a web site) ,i'm sorry ,that's not for you ! but who doesn't need a portfolio website  or a blog !? so if you do or even if you have already a website ,hosted say for example with the popular CMS WordPress,you may consider migrating to high quality static website with the cost from around 1$ to 12$ per year ,instead of your current costly plan ,isn't that mind blowing ? If yes just keep reading. 

Also having a static website doesn't mean you won't have functionlity such as form submission and handling ,contact and common services that usually need a server side code.Don't worry i'll show you how to add these services to your website without having to use your own server side language/code.

In which cases you can use Jekyll
-------------------------------------

You can use Jekyll if you need a personal website.

You can use Jekyll if you need a website for your business.

You can use Jekyll for a portfolio website.

You can use Jekyll for your blog,it's great ,easy to use,easy configurable and non costly alternative to WordPress.

We are going to use Jekyll ,it's true that you can take any bunch of HTML,CSS and JavaScript and create a static website but using Jekyll,which is a static site generator,gives you more control on your website content and more features for your website.

Some words about Jekyll
------------------------

Jekyll is a blog aware static site generator,built by GitHub,it is also the engine behind GitHub pages .Using Jekyll you can create simple static websites and also full featured blogs because it undersands well concepts such as posts,categories,tags and pagination which are the basic constructs of any decent blogging system.

You can easilly take a bunch of html files and create your static website with Jekyll by just adding a _config.md file in your website root folder and the output folder  _site but to get the most benefits of  Jekyll you need to understand other things such as : 

The anatomy of a Jekyll powered website/blog

The YAML Front Matter language 

The Liquid templating language (a primer on liquid templating language)
