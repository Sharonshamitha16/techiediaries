In this tutorial, we'll create a simple example with Angular 9/8 and `HttpClient` that sends Ajax Get and Post requests to fetch and post data from/to a backend server.

The server can be either your own server or a third-party server.

In our case, we'll be using a third-party server.

We assume you already have a project ready and [Angular CLI installed](https://www.techiediaries.com/angular-cli-tutorial/).

You can also simply use the online Stackblitz IDE if you just want to experiment with the code and don't want to set up a development environment for Angular, yet!


## Importing `HttpClientModule`

`HttpClientModule` is the module that exports the `HttpClient` service, so you'll need to import it in your project.

Open the `src/app/app.module.ts` file and update it as follows:

```ts
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    HttpClientModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

We simply need to import `HttpClientModule` from `@angular/common/http` and add it to the `imports` array of `NgModule`.

## Generate an Angular Service

In your terminal, simply execute the following command from inside your project's folder:

```bash
$ ng generate service http
```

You'll get the files for your service with some basic code.

Go to the `src/app/http.service.ts` file and import `HttpClient`:

```ts
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
```

Next, inject `HttpClient` using the constructor of your http service:

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class HttpService {

  constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) { }
}
```

That's it! We are ready to send get and post requests in our app.

## Sending an Ajax GET Request

Let's start with defining a service method for sending a get request to the server to fetch some data:

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class HttpService {

  apiUrl = "/api/endpoint";
  constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) { }

  sendGetRequest() {
    return this.httpClient.get(this.apiUrl);
  }
}
```

Let's suppose our endpoint returns the following data:

```json
[
     { id: '1', name: 'Product 1'},	
     { id: '2', name: 'Product 2'}
] 
```

## Sending an Ajax POST Request

Next, let's define a method for sending a post request:

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';


@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class HttpService {

  apiUrl = "/api/endpoint";
  constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) { }

  sendPostRequest(data: Object): Observable<Object> {
    return this.http.post(this.apiUrl, data);
  }
}
```




You next need to inject `HttpService` in your component(s) and call the methods but to actually send the requests to the server you need to subscribe to the RxJS observables returned from the defined methods. For example:


```ts
this.httpService.sendGetRequest().subscribe((responseBody) => {
      console.log(responseBody);
});
```

This will work provided that you have injected your service as `httpService` in your component's constructor.
