AngularJS CDN Integration Process (Updated

Today, the majority of internet users are fed up with the network latency, which is the annoying delay while loading the web pages, images, documents or while playing games over the internet. This leads to losing your users, rankings, user engagement, and more.

Are you facing the same latency issue with your website? If yes, then you’re in the right place to know how to get rid of this issue. We can resolve this latency issue by  **integrating the AngularJS with CDN**  (Content Delivery Network).

### Introduction to AngularJS:

AngularJs is a client-side open-source framework for building dynamic web page applications. It allows you to extend the HTML syntax to express your application components clearly. To accelerate the front-end development, few features like dependency injection, two-way data binding, declarative user interface, etc. are used. Formerly, many dynamic applications and static documents are integrated together with the help of a framework and a library. AngularJs attempts different approaches to create the HTML constructs and minimizes the impedance mismatch between the documents of centric HTML.

### Introduction to CDN:

CDN - Content Delivery Network is a highly distributed group of servers that helps to minimize the delay in loading the web pages and also provides high quality, fast delivery internet content to the end-users. A CDN enables you to share the information needed for loading Internet content such as javascript files, images, HTML pages, videos, and stylesheets. A proper configured CDN may protect the website from malicious attacks.

## AngularJS CDN Integration Process

AngularJs CDN is ideal for delivering the files efficiently, and it allows the user to retrieve the data from the most optimal CDN server rather than from the original server. The AngularJs CDN integration has so many advantages, such as HTTP/2-supported servers, CORS, an extensive network of data centers, etc. The below snippet demonstrates the configuration of integrating the AngularJs with the CD.

### Including AngularJS Scripts from the Google CDN

The easiest way to get started is to subject your html script tag to the Google CDN Url. In this way, you don’t have to download or maintain a local copy.

There are two types of AngularJs script URLs. You can subject to one for production and one for development.

**angular.js**  — This is suitable for web development, non-minified version, human-readable.

**angular.min.js**  — This is the minified version, which we strongly suggest you use in production.

To subject your code to an AngularJS script on the Google CDN server, use the following format. This example subject to the minified version 1.5.6:

3

4

5

6

7

8

9

`<!doctype html>`

`<html ng-app>`

`<head>`

`<title> AngularJS CDN Integration </title>`

`<script src=``"[https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.6/angular.min.js](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.5.6/angular.min.js)"``></script>`

`</head>`

`<body>`

`</body>`

`</html>`

Using the above script tag, we are trying to download the angularjs.min.js file whose version is 1.5.6. If you want to download the 1.7.8 latest version of the file that is available on the Google CDN, simply replace the version number segment in the Url.

For example, to download AngularJs 1.7.8, write the following snippet.

1

`<script src=``"[https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.7.8/angular.min.js](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.7.8/angular.min.js)"``></script>`

All stable versions are written separately by using commas that are available on Google CDN. Heading on the CDN page “stable versions:”

### AngularJS cdnjs CDN

There are many other reliable CDNs that support AngularJs files and cdnjs is one among them. AngularJs files can be used from cdnjs at http://cdnjs.com/libraries/angular.js/

Angular.js files are also available on this CDN. Copy the following script tag to change the version.

`<script src=``"[https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.5.6/angular.min.js](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.5.6/angular.min.js)"``></script>`

## Advantages of using Angular CDN Integration

There are numerous advantages to the AngularJs CDN integration. The following are the key points.

-   Users can download the documents quickly, and it can deliver the asset through the closest available CDN server.
-   It reduces the amount of content load on the origin server since it delivers the content through the CDN Server.
-   Integration is an easy task and it can be done in a few minutes.

Make your website visitors happy by delivering the documents or files quickly by using the AngularJs libraries and frameworks through the CDN.
