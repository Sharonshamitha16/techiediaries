Nowadays, with the great expectations from users for instant web experiences and the web becoming a first class platform for apps, also the complexities of web development tools, the facts that half traffic is coming from mobile devices and half mobile devices are connected through slow 3G networks, building a web application (especially for the mobile web) is not the end of story, you'll have to make sure users will be able to use it with the expected performance and speed.

Many studies have made it clear that web apps performance makes a big difference. for example a [DoubleClick study has shown that 53%](https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/articles/mobile-speed-matters/) of mobile app visits are abandoned if it takes more than 3 seconds for the app to load.
