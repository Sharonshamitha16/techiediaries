## CSRF Protection in Django


Django backend that requires every POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE request to have a valid CSRF token. 



While building a web app using Django as backend with Angular JS I came accross with a page not found 404 error when I was trying to send some data using the Angularâ€™s $http.post().

When trying to send a form using a POST method it needs to be verified with CSRF. If you are using Angular this verification method does not work.
