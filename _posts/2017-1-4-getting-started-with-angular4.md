Have you heard ! Angular 4 ,in its beta version, is out .Yes believe it .

The First thing to know there will be no Angular 3 ,Google is jumping directly to version 4 but that’s just a matter version number because they want to align with the version of new router designed for Angular framework  .

The second thing to know ,don’t freak out and don’t worry because unlike the transition from Angular 1.x to Angular 2 ,this is not a breaking and completely new update .Angular 4 is just Angular 2 with some fixes and improvement just like any normal framework update .  

The Angular 4 beta version has been released on  December 15,2016
