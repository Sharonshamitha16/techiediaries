React Native for Beginners is a book that will help you learn React Native from scratch and step by step through building simple and relatively complex apps.

React Native is now one of the most popular hybrid framewoks for building mobile apps with JavaScript so learning it will open for you more opportunities in the job market.

It's based on React which is the most frontend library for building user interfaces so if you learn React Native, you'll end up learning most of React and vice versa!

In the first example, you'll learn to build a mobile app for reading and saving news articles available from a REST API.

The book is work on progress, so we'll be adding more examples and show you how to build them step by step.

You can get the book from [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/react-native-for-beginners).
