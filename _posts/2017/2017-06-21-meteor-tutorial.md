In this **Meteor** tutorial, you'll learn about Meteor--a full stack JavaScript framework for building real time web applications with blazing speed.

Throughout this tutorial we'll go through all basic concepts of Meteor such as reactivity, templates and collections.

We will also cover advanced Meteor concepts and packages to build apps without reinventing the wheel.

This tutorial is suitable for beginners and also for professional JavaScript developers who are already 
using a framework and want to experiment or maybe switch to Meteor.

## The Seven Principles Of Meteor 

Meteor has seven principles which have contributed to make it a special web framework in the world of JavaScript.
Lets discover them one by one:

### Meteor is a data on the wire framework 

Client and server has distinct parts. The server is responsible for sending data without HTML, the client then 
takes responsibility to render and display received data.

### JavaScript on client and server sides

Meteor is based on NodeJS platform which means it uses JavaScript on the server and since on clients JavaScript 
is the only spoken language, Meteor uses JavaScript on both sides. You don't need any other programming language, except JavaScript, to develop full stack and fully working web apps.

### Database or Data everywhere

Meteor provides two databases, one on the server side just like any other framework and one on the client 
side, it's an mini implementation of Mongo database.

### Latency compensation 

Meteor pre-fetches data on the client side so the user gets the impression that server calls returns instantly.

### Reactive framework 

Meteor uses reactive programming to deliver the developer from writing extra code to update the user interface 
when data changes instead their user interfaces components auto update themselves any time data changes.


### Meteor is Open Source

Meteor is an open source JavaScript framework which can be also used with other open source frameworks to build 
delightful professional apps. 

### Simplicity and Productivity

Meteor focus on simplicity and productivity. It has a clean and easy to grasp API which make it easy to build 
production ready apps in a time record.


Meteor is available for the three most popular operating systems i.e Windows ,Linux and MAC OS .

The process of installing Meteor is dead easy so lets get started by installing it .

## Install Meteor On Windows 

Installing Meteor On Windows is a matter of downloading the official Meteor installer from the [official 
website](https://install.meteor.com/windows?_ga=2.190701483.1098480667.1498082043-1683292587.1498082043)

Then follow the installer just like any Windows program.

## Installing on Linux and MAC

Make sure you have curl installed on your machine ,next open your terminal and type:

        curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh

This command line is sufficient to install the latest official Meteor release on your machine.

After installing Meteor, depending on your operating system you are now ready to follow the rest of this tutorial in which we are going to build multiple simple and advanced Meteor apps.
