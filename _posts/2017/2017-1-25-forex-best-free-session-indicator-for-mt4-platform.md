Any Forex trader with a good trading experience understands very well that trading sessions play a big and major  role in any successful strategy for entering and closing  positions .Keeping an eye on sessions start and endings can be forgotten that’s way clever developers created a bunch of indicators that help traders knows at every moment the current trading session throughout the day .

I’ve tried many trading sessions indicators but not all of them distinguish between sessions in a clean and helpful way so in this post i’ll show the one that really proved to be what I was personally looking for .

This is the best trading session indicator for MT4 platform .At least the best from a bunch of indicators i’ve tried in the last years .

I think a lot of traders have heard of or even used  i-Sessions indicator .If you did not just download from the link and keep reading .If yes keep reading too because i’ll show some helpful information on how to take the most benefits from this indicator while keeping your charts as clean as possible .Personally I think  that’s a good indicator is the one which can do its job without making your charts more complex than what they already are .

First of all,the i-Sessions indicator for MT4 platform can be helpful only on timeframes lower than and not including 4 hours .You can use in 1 hour timeframe and 15/30 minutes timeframes .

You can choose any session to trade depending on your trading strategy but the majority of traders find The New York and London sessions to be the best sessions for good results especially for the most traded pair EURO/USD .If you trade Asian currencies like the Japanese Yen then you should focus on the Asian session .  
 
Keep in mind that you divide the trading day into many sessions but the ones which are really important worldwide are the London , New York and Asian Sessions with the most traders focusing mainly on the open/close period of NewYork and London sessions .That’s why the i-Sessions indicator focus on these two periods and can be very handy for spotting them .

So now how can easily spot the sessions .First the Asian session is very easy to spot .It starts at the beginning of period ,the vertical dashed line.

When the Asian session box ends,The London session starts ,after sometime the Asian session ends .It’s not shown because that’s not very important .

The New York session starts at the beginning of the second box  ,and the London session closes at the end of the second box .So the second box shows you the most important trading zone on the day when London and New York sessions overlaps .

The New York session ends at the end of the trading day shown by period separator .

If you don’t like the colors and you want to change them you can easily do that in indicator settings
