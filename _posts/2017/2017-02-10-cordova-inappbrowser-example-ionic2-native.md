Throughout this tutorial, we are going to see a detailed example showing how to open external URLs in Ionic 5 mobile 
apps based on Angular using the Cordova plugin InAppBrowser and Ionic Native.

Now let's get started! 

## Create a New Ionic 5/Angular Project

We will start by generating a new Ionic 5/Angular project with Ionic CLI 4 so open up your terminal if your are developing
under a Linux/MAC system or your command prompt under Windows and type!

    ionic start ionic-inappbrowser-example blank --type=angular 

> Note: Under Windows the recommended way to work with Ionic 5 is through visual studio.

Next, navigate inside your project folder: 

    cd ionic-inappbrowser-example

Add your target platform using the following command:

    cordova platform add android 

We are developing with Ubuntu so we can only target Android devices. If you are under a MAC you can target iOS too using:

    cordova platform add iOS

> Note : If you don't have Cordova already installed you can easilly install it via npm with

    npm install -g cordova 

## Adding the InAppBrowser Cordova Plugin    

Next, you just need to add the InAppBrowser plugin using the following command: 

    cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-inappbrowser

Now we are ready to add some code to our project to open external URLs. So go ahead and open the `home.ts` file
and modify it to look like the following:

    

    import { Component } from '@angular/core';

    import { NavController , Platform} from 'ionic-angular';

    import { InAppBrowser } from 'ionic-native';

    @Component({
    selector: 'page-home',
    templateUrl: 'home.html'
    })
    export class HomePage {

    constructor( public platform: Platform,public navCtrl: NavController) {
        
    }
    openUrl() {

            this.platform.ready().then(() => {
                let browser = new InAppBrowser("https://www.techiediaries.com",'_blank');

            });
    }    
    }


We have started by importing the InAppBrowser plugin from the `ionic-native` module then we have
added the `openUrl()` method that will handle opening the specified URL.

Next open your your template and add the button to test the method: 

  <button ion-button="" large="" color="primary" (click)="openUrl()" >Visit Techiediaries</button>

> Note: Don't use the old `.open()` method

     InAppBrowser.open(url, "_system");

Many developers are getting this error 

<b>
Uncaught Error: Can't resolve all parameters for InAppBrowser: (?, ?, ?).    
</b>

Because it is deprecated with Ionic Native. Instead you should use the following method: 

    let browser = new InAppBrowser('YOUR_URL', "_system");


## Serving your Ionic 5 App

Next, just execute the following command: 

    ionic serve 

You can the play with your demo on the browser by visiting the `http://localhost:8100/` address.

When you are finished testing, you can build your app for you target platform using the following command:

    ionic build android | iOS
