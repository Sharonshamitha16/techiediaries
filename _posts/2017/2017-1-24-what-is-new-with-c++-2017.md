I have always admired the C++ language since the first days of my programming journey .C++ is the first language i’ve learned and used ( alongside C ) and this is the case of many developers around the world so what is C++ ?

C++ is an object oriented language based on C ,more properly it is an extension to C .It was first called C with classes when it was created by  Bjarne Stroustrup  about 33 years ago .C++ is more powerful than Java because unlike Java it is a native language which don’t need any virtual machine to run .C++ has modern OOP features but still close enough to the machine which makes programs written in C++ faster than their counterparts in Java or any modern OOP language.

C++2017
----------------
---------------

C++2017 is a new era in the evolution of C++ language which introduces a set of modern features such as

Dynamic memory allocation for over aligned data 

Forward process guarantees (FPG)

Structured bindings

if (init; condition) and switch (init; condition)

constexpr if

Inline variables 

Etc .

Unlike modern OOP languages such as Java C++ is complex and hard to learn or use .
The language has many different ways of doing things .C++2017 tries to simplify the language
 and adds more modern features .
