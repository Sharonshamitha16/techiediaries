In this post, you'll learn about the top programming languages that you need to learn in 2019.

In this post, I'll try to gather some facts and statistics from different sources to support my opinion.

Most wanna-be programmers or developers start their journey with this question:

**What Programming language do I need to learn?**

This question is very important and it's not a waste of time at all but you will need to be careful not to spend much time in deciding the first programming language you need to learn instead of actually start learning.

Also the answer to this question is not definitive and it actually depends on many criteria.

Before starting with the list of programming languages, we need to agree on some facts. First, most programmers know more that one programming language so even if you start with a specific language for some reason, you will usually end up learning more languages in your career or even when you are still a student. Second, no programming language is better than the other. It's a matter of choice and goals. For example some languages are better for system programming or game development, some other are more beginners friendlier and easy to grasp for beginners. Other languages have better tools and bigger communities etc. But it finally comes down to what you need to achieve!

Without further ado, let's get started with the top programming languages in 2019!
