In this post, we'll see how we can install Oracle Java 11 LTS (Long Time Support) and Java 12 on Ubuntu 19.04 (or also Ubuntu 18.04).

Java 11 is the LTS version of Java. As Java 8 has ended support in Junuary 2019, companies will be upgrading their projects to current LTS version. 

Java 12 is the latest version which has brought many [new features and enhancements](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/12-relnote-issues-5211422.html).

It's not recommended to use Java 12 in production but you can use it for hobby projects or to experiment with the new features.

## How to Install Java 11 LTS on Ubuntu 19.04?

Open a terminal and start by adding the Linux Uprising PPA, which contains Oracle Java 11 (LTS) and 12 installers for Ubuntu, Linux Mint and Debian,using the following command:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/java
```

On Ubuntu 19.04, you don't need to update your system packages using:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
```

Finally, you can install Java 11 LTS using:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install oracle-java11-installer
```

You need to accept the license (press Tab to highlight OK and hit Enter):

$ sudo apt-get install oracle-java11-set-default
```

You can check your installed version of Java using:

You can uninstall Java 11 from your system using:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get remove oracle-java11-installer
```

## Installing Java 12 on Ubuntu 19.04 Using a PPA

You can find the packages of Oracle JDK 12 for Ubuntu from the **Linuxuprising** PPA repository. 

Open a new terminal and run the following command to add this PPA to your system:

```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/java
```

Enter your password when prompted and hit Enter.

Next, you need to run the following command to update your system repositories:

```bash
$ sudo apt update
```

Finally, you can install Java 12 on your system by running the following command:

```bash
$ sudo apt install oracle-java12-installer
```

You can set Java 12 as the default version in your system using `oracle-java12-set-default`:

```bash
$ sudo apt y install oracle-java12-set-default
```

## Installing Java 12 Without a PPA on Ubuntu 19.04

You can also install Java 12 on your system without using a PPA. 

Go to the [Oracle official website](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk12-downloads-5295953.html) and download the deb package for JDK 12.

Next, open your terminal and navigate to where you have downloaded the deb package and run the following command:

```bash
$ sudo dpkg -i jdk-12.0.1_linux-x64_bin.deb
```

That's it! You have installed Java 12 on your Ubuntu 19.04 system.
