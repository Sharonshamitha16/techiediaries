In this quick tutorial, you'll learn how to use NgForm in Angular 7 to work with forms. You'll also learn about template reference variables and how you can use them to reference DOM elements or Angular built-in directives (such as `ngForm`) in your templates.

## What is NgForm

So, what is [NgForm](https://angular.io/api/forms/NgForm)?

It's simply a directive exported from `FormsModule` which gets automatically added to all `<form>` tags in your Angular templates once you import the module.  

Behind the curtains, the `ngForm` directive creates a top-level `FormGroup` instance and binds it to your `<form>` tag to enable you to work with the form. For example to access the aggregate form value or check validation status.

## How to Access NgForm

Since the `ngForm` directive is implicitly added in your `<form>` tag when you import its parent module (`FormsModule`) in your application, you don't need to do any configuration to start working with template-based forms. 

You can simply get a reference to your form' `ngForm` directive by exporting it into a local template variable and by using the `ngForm` directive as the value of the variable (`#myForm=ngForm`).   


## Using ngNoForm

If you you want to import `FormsModule` in your application but want to skip a specific form, you can use the `ngNoForm` directive which will prevent `ngForm` from being added to the form.
 
## How to Use NgForm in Your Angular Application

Provided that you have generated a project with Angular CLI and you are ready to start developing your application. Let's see how you can use the `ngForm` directive.

First, open the `src/app/app.module.ts` file and import `FormsModule` from the `@angular/forms` package then add it in the `imports` array of the module metadata (or `@NgModule`):

```ts
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';


@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    AppRoutingModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

 > **Note**: Please note that you can also import `FormsModule` in a sub-module of your application where you want to use template-based forms not necessarily the main application module.

Now, you have NgForm implicitly active in all `<form>` tags (unless you add the `ngNoForm` directive to some specific form).

Next, you need to get a reference to the created `ngForm` directive in the form you are working with. For this matter, you can use a  template reference variable.

## What is a Template Reference Variable 

Here is the definition of a template reference variables from the [official docs](https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#ref-vars):

>A  **template reference variable**  is often a reference to a DOM element within a template. It can also be a reference to an Angular component or directive or a  [web component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components "MDN: Web Components").

You can simply use the hash symbol (`#`) to create a reference variable in your template which will be only available in that template.

In case you want to reference a directive like `ngForm` instead of the DOM element where the variable was declared, you simply need to set the value of the variable explicitly to the directive i.e `#myForm="ngForm"`. 

Next, you need to create a component. Let's suppose that we need to create a user register component. In your terminal, run:

```bash
$ ng generate component register
```

The component will be automatically added to your module by the Angular CLI.

 Open the `src/app/register/register.component.html` file and add the following template:

```html
<form #myform="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="register(myform)" class="form form-register">
  <label for="register-email">Email</label>

  <input name="email" id="register-email" type="email" placeholder="Email" ngModel required>
  <label for="register-password">Password</label>
  <input name="password" id="register-password" type="password" placeholder="Password" ngModel required>

  <input type="submit" value="Register">
</form>
``` 

In the example, we declared a template reference variable called `myform` that references the `ngForm` directive of the registration form.

Since you can now use the `myform` template variable everywhere in your template, you can pass it to the `register()` method bound to the `ngSubmit` event which will be called when your submit the form.

Using the `myform` variable, you can access many useful properties of `ngForm`  either in your template or in your component:

- `myform.value`: It will provides you with the aggregated form value of all the fields used in your `<form>` tag,  
-  `myform.valid`: It will provides you with a boolean value indicating if the form is valid or not,  
- `myform.touched`: It will provides you with a boolean value indicating if the user has entered value at least in one field,  
- `myform.submitted`: It will provides with a boolean value indicating if the form was submitted. 

Next, open the `src/app/register/register.component.ts` file and  add the `register()` method:

```ts
export class RegisterComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit() {}

  register(form) {
    console.log(form.value);
    console.log(form.touched);
    console.log(form.submitted);   
  }
}
```

The `.value` property provides the value of all fields of the form but you can also access the values of individual fields using the `controls` array:

```ts
  register(form: NgForm) {
 console.log(userForm.controls['email'].value);
 console.log(userForm.controls['password'].value);   
  }
```

> Note: Don't forget to import `NgForm` from the `@angular/forms` package in your component.

## Resetting a Form

You can also reset the form using the template variable to the `ngForm` directive. In you component, add the following method:

```ts
 resetForm(form:  NgForm)  { 		 
	 form.resetForm();  
 }
```

We simply call the `resetForm()` of the `ngForm` variable.

## Conclusion

In this quick tutorial, you have seen how you can use the `ngForm` directive and template reference variables to work with forms in Angular 7.
