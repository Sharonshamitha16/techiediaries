The Angular 7/8 Router is a powerful router library that allows developers to implement advanced functionality in their Angular applications, beside basic component routing, such as:

- Route protection using guards,
- Route parameters, 
- Child routes,
- Auxiliary routes etc.

 
In the previous [tutorial](https://www.techiediaries.com/angular-router), we have created a basic routing between components with the Angular Router. In this tutorial we're going to see how to handle route parameters in Angular 8.

We are going to start from the simple Angular application we've build in the previous Router tutorial which you can find from this [repository](https://github.com/techiediaries/angular-router-demo) or in [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/techiediaries/angular-router-demo). 

This is the implementation of the `ProductDetailComponent`:

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from "@angular/core";
import { Product } from "../models/product";
@Component({
  selector: "product-detail",
  templateUrl: "./product-detail.component.html",
  styleUrls: []
})
export class ProductDetailComponent implements OnInit {
  

  public products: Product[] = [
    new Product(1, "Product 001"),
    new Product(2, "Product 002"),
    new Product(3, "Product 003"),
    new Product(4, "Product 004"),
    new Product(5, "Product 005"),
    new Product(6, "Product 006"),
    new Product(7, "Product 007"),
    new Product(8, "Product 008")
  ];
  product: Product = this.products[0];// this will store the current product to display	

  constructor() {}
  ngOnInit() {
  }
}
```  

In the previous tutorial, we've added this route object in our router configuration:

```ts
  { path: "product/:id", component: ProductDetailComponent }
```

The `:id` placeholder (called dynamic router parameter) means that the `ProductDetailComponent` component will be activated when the user visits any path that matches this expression: `/product/[0-9|a-b|A-B]+`.

The Angular Router will also allow you to retrieve the value of `:id` from the activated component (i.e in this case `ProductDetailComponent` ) so let's see how?

## How to Get Route Parameters

The Angular Router provides two different methods to get route parameters:

- Using the route snapshot,
- Using Router Observables

## Navigation Using The RouterLink Directive with Parameters

Open `src/app/product-list/product-list.component.html` then change the list of products to use anchor tags with the `routerLink` directive to be able to navigate the `ProductDetailComponent` component.

```html
<h1>Products List</h1>

<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let product of products">
    <a [routerLink]="['/product',product.id]">{{product.name}}</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

You can also create links using:

```html
<a routerLink="/product/{{product.id}}">{{product.name}}</a>
```

After creating the links with parameters. We can now proceed to see how we can retrieve the `id` parameter from the URL in the `ProductDetailComponent`.

The Angular Router provides the [ActivatedRoute](https://angular.io/api/router/ActivatedRoute) class that can be injected in the component. So first start by importing it using:

```typescript
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';
```

Next, you need to inject this class in the component via the constructor:

```typescript
  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {}
```

In the `ngOnInit` life-cycle method of the component we'll add the necessary code to grab the route parameter by subscribing to the `params` map or `paramMap` (instance of [ParamMap](https://angular.io/api/router/ParamMap), available only in Angular 4+) of the injected instance:

```typescript
  ngOnInit() {
    this.route.paramMap.subscribe(params => {
      this.products.forEach((p: Product) => {
        if (p.id == params.id) {
          this.product = p;
        }
      });
    });
  }
```

After subscribing to the `paramMap` we grab the parameters by their names in the path object (i.e in our case `id`) `params.id`. The rest of the code is just iterating over the products array to find the corresponding product to display via its *id*.

You can also use the *snapshot* object of the `ActivatedRoute` instance: `this.route.snapshot.params.id`

```typescript
  ngOnInit() {
      this.products.forEach((p: Product) => {
        if (p.id == this.route.snapshot.params.id) {
          this.product = p;
        }
      });
    
  }
```  



## Conclusion

The Angular Router allows you to easily retrieve parameters from the URL which is an essential functionality that's required by most web applications. You can use both ways: the `paramMap` observable or the snapshot way but the latter requires you to be careful when re-using components. You can find the code in this [repository](https://github.com/techiediaries/angular-router-demo).

In this tutorial, we have seen an Angular 8 example that demonstrates how to retrieve route paramters.
