So first things first .What is Adsense for those who don’t know yet ?

We are at 2017 and I still find people on forums asking for what Adsense is ? and how can I make money from Adsense ? 

AdSense is a Google program for sharing revenue from advertisements between Google and publishers who show Google ads in their websites . So Google get ads from advertisers via another program called Adwords then allow publishers to show these advertisements in their websites for a share of the revenue which Google receives from the advertiser .Adsense started in 2003 and till now there is better option for monetizing your website traffic than this program . It is not a scheme for getting rich overnight but it can helps make a good amount of money if you have a decent amount of traffic .

Simply understand this formula :

    Traffic + Adsense Ads == $$$$

When your apply for a Google Adsense account and you get approved then you are considered as a publisher .You can create ad units ,get the code and put it in your website pages .When some visitor clicks on the ads on your website you earn some amount of money which varies depending on many criteria .This is model is called a Cost Per Click model CPC .You can also earn from AdSense via a CPM model which is Cost Per Million impressions .

The AdSense program is free to join .You don’t even need a website you can easily start a blog on their blogging platform and apply for a hosted AdSense account .

There are two types of AdSense accounts a hosted account and a normal account .Simply a hosted account can’t be used outside of Google Blogger platform or a YouTube channel .In contrary a normal AdSense account can be used to make money from any website that you own supposing it meets all Google rules . 

You can start by having a hosted account then transform it to a normal account .

To apply for a hosted account you need either a blog on Blogger or a YouTube channel .

To transform a hosted account to a normal account you need a website which has a domain name and some content that meets Google rules .
