In this tutorial, we'll be creating a CRUD (Create Read Update and Delete) web application using new and modern front-end technologies (React, Axios and Bootstrap 4) in the client side and PHP 7 with a MySQL database in the back-end or server side. CRUD operations are the basis for most web applications where users need to insert, update, list and delete records from an underlying database (in our case it's MySQL + PHP) via an admin/back-office interface (JavaScript and React) so you can extend the example in this tutorial to create more advanced app for some advanced use cases.
