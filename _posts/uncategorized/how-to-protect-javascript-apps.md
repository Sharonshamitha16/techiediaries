So is it possible to protect JavaScript apps ?

This is a question that gets asked many times by JavaScript developers so i decided to write a post 
about this subject .

Client side code can't be protected from being viewed or even modified .Many developers try to abfuscate it 
as a protection mesaurment but that's not possible because the code gets reconstructed on the browser and one 
can use the dev tools inside the browser to easilly see the reconstructed code so the standard way of serving
JavaScript from a server to the browser
