In this quick tutorial, we'll learn how to install and use the Vue.js library in your Laravel 6 or Laravel 7 project using the `laravel/ui` package. 

## A Separate Laravel 7/6 Package for Vue.js Scaffolding

The `laravel/ui` is a separate package that provides the UI scaffoldings for bootstrap, vue and react. Alongside with the auth scaffold for login and registration. 


Provided that you already have a Laravel project setup. Head over to your command-line interface and run the following command:

```bash
$ composer require laravel/ui
```

## Adding Vue to your Laravel 7/6 Project

After successfully installing the `laravel/ui` package, we can now add vue to our application.



Head back to your terminal and run the following artisan command:

```bash
$ php artisan ui vue
```

If you also need to add the auth scaffolding, add the `--auth` switch to the command:

```bash
$ php artisan ui vue --auth
```

## Installing Vue.js Dependencies

Now, you also need to install the Vue.js dependencies from npm using the following command:


```bash
$ npm install
```

You should have node and npm installed in your system for the previous command to work.
