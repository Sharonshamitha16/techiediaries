In this tutorial, you'll learn how to handle multi-part Form Data in React by implementing a simple file upload example. We'll use Axios and HTML5 `FormData`.

For the backend, we'll be using a simple PHP application that exposes a unique endpoint that accepts a POST request containing the file/image to upload.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have the following prerequisites for this tutorial:

- JavaScript Knowledge,
- A working experience of React,
- Knowledge of PHP,
- PHP installed on your machine,
- Node.js and NPM installed on your machine.


## Creating the PHP File Upload Application

Open a new terminal and create a folder for our project:

```bash
$ mkdir react-php-file-upload
```

Next, navigate inside your project's folder and create a `backend` folder with an `upload.php` file:

```bash
$ cd react-php-file-upload
$ mkdir backend && cd backend
$ touch upload.php
``` 

Open the `upload.php` file and add the following code:

```php
<?php 
header('Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8');
header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *");
header("Access-Control-Allow-Methods: PUT, GET, POST");



$response = array();
$upload_dir = 'uploads/';
$server_url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000';

if($_FILES['avatar'])
{
    $avatar_name = $_FILES["avatar"]["name"];
    $avatar_tmp_name = $_FILES["avatar"]["tmp_name"];
    $error = $_FILES["avatar"]["error"];

    if($error > 0){
        $response = array(
            "status" => "error",
            "error" => true,
            "message" => "Error uploading the file!"
        );
    }else 
    {
        $random_name = rand(1000,1000000)."-".$avatar_name;
        $upload_name = $upload_dir.strtolower($random_name);
        $upload_name = preg_replace('/\s+/', '-', $upload_name);
    
        if(move_uploaded_file($avatar_tmp_name , $upload_name)) {
            $response = array(
                "status" => "success",
                "error" => false,
                "message" => "File uploaded successfully",
                "url" => $server_url."/".$upload_name
              );
        }else
        {
            $response = array(
                "status" => "error",
                "error" => true,
                "message" => "Error uploading the file!"
            );
        }
    }    

}else{
    $response = array(
        "status" => "error",
        "error" => true,
        "message" => "No file was sent!"
    );
}

echo json_encode($response);
?>
```

Next, start the PHP server using the following command from the root of your project:

```bash
$ php -S 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Now, we have a running PHP server that exposes an `/upload.php` REST endpoint.

## Installing `create-react-app`

Let's install the `create-react-app` tool. Open a new terminal and run the following command:

```bash
$ npm install -g create-react-app
```

## Creating the React Application

Let's now create our React project. In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
$ cd react-php-file-upload
$ create-react-app frontend
```

After creating the files and installing the dependencies, you can start your React app using the following commands:

```bash
$ cd frontend
$ npm start
```

Your React app will be running from the `http://localhost:3000` address. This will also automatically open your web browser and navigate to that address.

## Create a React File Upload Form Component

Let's now create a component that contains a form for file uploading. In the `src/` folder, create a `FileUploadForm.js` file and start by adding the following code:

```js
import React from 'react'
import axios from 'axios';

class FileUploadForm extends React.Component {}
export default FileUploadForm;
```  

We import `React` and `axios` and we create and export the `FileUploadForm` component.


Next, create a `file` state variable for holding the file to upload:

```js
class FileUploadForm extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state ={
          file:null
        }
    }
}
``` 

## Creating a Form for Selecting the File

Next, define the `render()` method of the component which renders an HTML form:

```js
      render() {
        return (
          <form onSubmit={ this.onSubmit }>
            <h1> React File Upload Example</h1>
            <input type="file" onChange={ this.onChange } />
            <button type="submit">Upload File</button>
          </form>
       )
      }
```

We bind the `onSubmit` event of the form to the `onSubmit()` method and the `onChange` event of the `<input>` tag to the `onChange()` method which is called when selecting a file. 

Next, we need to define the `onSubmit()` and `onChange()` methods in the component as follows:

```js
    async onSubmit(e){
        e.preventDefault() 
        let res = await this.uploadFile(this.state.file);
        console.log(res.data);
    }
    onChange(e) {
        this.setState({file:e.target.files[0]})
    }
```

The `onChange()` method calls the `setState()` method to set the `file` state variable to the selected file. This method is called when a file is selected in the file `<input>` tag.

The `onSubmit()` method calls the `uploadFile()` method to upload the selected file to the PHP server. The file is passed as a parameter to the method from the `file` state variable.

## Uploading Files with Axios and FormData

Let's now define the `uploadFile()` method as follows:

```js
    async uploadFile(file){
        

        const formData = new FormData();
        
        formData.append('avatar',file)
        
        return  await axios.post(this.UPLOAD_ENDPOINT, formData,{
            headers: {
                'content-type': 'multipart/form-data'
            }
        });
      }
```

We first create an instance of `FormData`, next we append the file with the `avatar` key since our PHP file uploading app expects the file to exist under an `avatar` key in the `$_FILES` array.

Next, we call the `post()` method of `axios` and we pass the `formData` instance as the data object. We also set the `content-type` header of the request to `multipart/form-data`.   

Finally, open the `src/App.js` file and import the `FileUploadForm` component then call it in the `render()` method:

```js
import FileUploadForm  from "./FileUploadForm.js"

class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <FileUploadForm />
        );
    }
}
export default App;
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we have used React, Axios and the HTML5 `FormData` with a PHP server to create a simple file uploading example with a multi-part form data.
