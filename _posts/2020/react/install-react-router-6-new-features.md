React Router 6 is due to be released soon with many new features such as:

- Smaller size: The new version of the router will have smaller bundle size than the previous versions.
- Nested routing: React Router v6 now we can easily use nested routing. Previously making a nested routing is big mess and complex process to mange it.
- Switch will be replaced with Routes: `<Switch>` is replaced with <Routes>. Thanks to this new API, we can define all our routes in one place and have automatic route ranking as well as relative routes and links.
- useNavigate Instead of useHistory
Thanks to React Router v6 we can easily handle redirecting logic using the useNavigate hook.



## How Install React Router 6?

Head back to your command-line interface and run the following command:

```bash
$ npm install react-router@6 react-router-dom@6
```

At this time, before the final release of the library, you need to use the `6` tag with the command to install React Router 6.
