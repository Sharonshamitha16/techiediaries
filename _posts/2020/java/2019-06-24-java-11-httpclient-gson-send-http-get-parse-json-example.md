In this tutorial, we'll learn about the `HttpClient` library introduced in Java 11 for sending HTTP requests. We'll also see how to use the `Gson` library from Google to parse JSON data. 

We'll be using a single source file for our app which can be executed in Java 11 using the `java` command without first compiling it (using `javac`)just like a script file.

## Sending Http Requests Prior to Java 11

Prior to Java 11, developers had to use [URLConnection](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URLConnection.html) to send HTTP requests. This package doesn't have an easy to use API and doesn't support the newer HTTP/2 protocol - As a result developers resorted to use third-party libraries like [Apache HTTP Client](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/) 

> **Note**: `HttpClient` doesn't currently have some advanced features like multi-part form data and compression support.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have Java 11 LTS version installed on your system. You can simply go to the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system. If you are using Ubuntu 19.04, you can also follow this [tutorial](https://www.techiediaries.com/ubuntu-install-oracle-java) to install Java 11 on your system.

You will also need some working knowledge of Java.

## How to Use HttpClient in Java 11? 

`HttpClient` is available from the `java.net.http` package. 

Using `HttpClient` is as easy as adding one line of code:

```java
client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
```

Or also:

```java
client = HttpClient.newBuilder().build();
```

You can also customize every aspect of the client:

```java
var client = HttpClient.newBuilder()
            .authenticator(Authenticator.getDefault())
            .connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(60))
            .cookieHandler(CookieHandler.getDefault())
            .executor(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3))
            .followRedirects(Redirect.NEVER)
            .priority(2) 
            .proxy(ProxySelector.getDefault())
            .sslContext(SSLContext.getDefault())
            .version(Version.HTTP_2)
            .sslParameters(new SSLParameters())
            .build();
```

These methods are used to change the default values of settings like:

- HTTP/2,
- Connection timeout,
- Redirection policy,
- Cookie handlers,
- Authentication,
- The proxy selector,
- SSL.
 
You can also use `HttpRequest` available from the `java.net.HttpRequest` package to create requests and `HttpResponse` available from the `java.net.HttpResponse` package  to work with response objects. For example:

```java
var httpRequest = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
        .uri(URI.create("https://www.techiediaries/feed.xml"))
        .GET()
        .build();
```

Here, we specify the request URI using the `uri()` method , we call the `GET()` method to specify a GET request and and we call `build()` to create an instance of `HttpRequest`. You can also use the other methods such as `GET()`, `POST()`, `DELETE()` and `PUT()` or you can use `method()` to specify any HTTP method:

```java
var request = HttpRequest.newBuilder(URI.create("https://www.techiediaries/feed.xml"))
        .method("HEAD", BodyPublishers.noBody())
        .build();
```

You can use `BodyPublishers.noBody()` for requests that don't expect a body.

After building your request, you can send it using the `send()` method of the client:

```java
HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, BodyHandlers.ofString());
```

[`BodyHandlers.ofString()`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.html#ofString()) converts the response raw data to a String. These are other options:

```java
BodyHandlers::ofByteArray
BodyHandlers::ofFile
BodyHandlers::ofString
BodyHandlers::ofInputStream
```

> **Note**: You can also send requests asynchronously using the `sendAsync()` method. Check the [docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html#sendAsync(java.net.http.HttpRequest,java.net.http.HttpResponse.BodyHandler)) for more information.

## Java 11 & HttpClient Example

Now, let's build a simple Java 11 example application that makes use of `HttpClient` to fetch data from a third-party REST API and display it. We'll be using a news REST API available from [newsapi](https://newsapi.org/).

You first need to head [to their website](https://newsapi.org/register) and register for an API key.

After submitting the form. You will be redirected to a page where you can get your API key.

## Java 11 Single Source Files or Scripts

Starting with Java 11, you can write script files as you don't have to first  compile your source code  with `javac` before  executing it with `java`.

For a single source code file, you can run the file directly with the `java` command and JVM will execute it. You can even use the shebang syntax in Unix based systems like Linux and macOS.
    
Open a new terminal, navigate inside a working folder and create a single file with the `.java` extension:

```bash
$ touch NewsScript.java
```

Next, open the file and add the following code:

```java
public class NewsScript {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("### NewsScript! v1.0: Get Daily News ###");
    }
}
```

We simply create a Java class with a static main method and we call the `println()` method to display the `### NewsScript! v1.0: Get Daily News ###` string on the console.

Let's now run the file. Head back to your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
$ java NewsScript.java
```

If  you have Java 11, that should run the file and display the message on the console.

## Sending HTTP GET Requests with Java 11+ HttpClient

Now, let's actually get the news. In your source file add the following code:

```java
import  java.net.http.HttpClient;
import  java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import  java.net.http.HttpResponse;
import java.net.URI;

public class NewsScript {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("### NewsScript! v1.0: Get Daily News ###");
        String API_KEY = "<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>";
    
        var client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();

        var httpRequest = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
        .uri(URI.create(String.format("https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=techcrunch&apiKey=%s", API_KEY)))
        .GET()
        .build();

        try{
            var response = client.send(httpRequest, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
            System.out.println(response.body());
    


        }catch(Exception e){
            e.printStackTrace();
        }


    }
 
}
```

Make sure your replace  `<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>` with your actual API key from the News API.

If your run this code, you should get the news data printed as a JSON string with news entries. 

## Parsing JSON Data with Gson in Java 11

We need to parse the JSON string as a Java object so we can work with it. 

Since Java doesn't have any native JSON module, we'll make use of `gson`, a library by Google for working with JSON in Java. 

Since we are creating a single file script without Maven or Gradle, we need to download the jar file of the library and put it in the folder of our Java file. 

Head to this [Maven repo](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/google/code/gson/gson/2.6.2/) and download the `.jar` file.

Now, when running the script, you should add the current folder in the class path of your app as follows:

```bash
$ java --class-path './*'  NewsScript.java
```

Next, let's parse our news data into Java objects. First, we need to create the following Data Transfer Objects or DTOs that correspond to the JSON structure of the returned data:

```java
class NewsDTO
{
  String status; 
  int totalResults;
  ArrayList<ArticleDTO> articles;
}

class ArticleDTO
{
  SourceDTO source;  
  String author;
  String title;
  String description;
  String url; 
}


class SourceDTO{
    String id;
    String name;
}
```

You need to import `ArrayList` using `import  java.util.ArrayList;` in your code.

> **Note**: These DTOs should be placed below the main class.

Next, import the `Gson` class:

```java
import  com.google.gson.Gson;
```

Next, change the code in the `try{} catch(){}` block  inside the `main()` method as follows:

```java
        try{
            var response = client.send(httpRequest, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());

            NewsDTO obj = new Gson().fromJson(response.body(), NewsDTO.class);

            for (ArticleDTO art : obj.articles) {
			            System.out.println("### "+ art.title + " ### \n");
                        
                        System.out.println(art.description);
                        System.out.println("\nRead more: " + art.url + "\n");
                        
                        
		    }

        }catch(Exception e){
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
```

We simply call the `fromJson()` method available from the `Gson` instance and we pass in the response body which contains a JSON string. This will convert the string to an object  of the `NewsDTO` type. 

Finally, we iterate over the `articles` array (of `ArticleDTO` objects) from the `NewsDTO` object and we print the `title`, `description` and `URL` of each item to the standard output.

That's it! If we run our script using the following command:

```bash
$ java --class-path './*'  NewsScript.java
```

We should get something like the following screenshot:

import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
import java.net.URI;

import com.google.gson.Gson;


public class NewsScript {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("### NewsScript! v1.0: Get Daily News ###");
        String API_KEY = "<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>";
    
        var client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();

        var httpRequest = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
        .uri(URI.create(String.format("https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=techcrunch&apiKey=%s", API_KEY)))
        .GET()
        .build();

        try{
            var response = client.send(httpRequest, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
            //System.out.println(response.body());
    
            NewsDTO obj = new Gson().fromJson(response.body(), NewsDTO.class);
            
            //System.out.println(obj.articles);

            for (ArticleDTO art : obj.articles) {
			            System.out.println("### "+ art.title + " ### \n");
                        
                        System.out.println(art.description);
                        System.out.println("\nRead more: " + art.url + "\n");
                        
                        
		    }

        }catch(Exception e){
            e.printStackTrace();
        }


    }
 
}

class NewsDTO
{
  String status; 
  int totalResults;
  ArrayList<ArticleDTO> articles;
}

class ArticleDTO
{
  SourceDTO source;  
  String author;
  String title;
  String description;
  String url; 
}


class SourceDTO{
    String id;
    String name;
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've used Java 11 `HttpClient` for sending HTTP requests with the `Gson` library for parsing JSON data to build a simple news application that allows you to read news from your terminal.
