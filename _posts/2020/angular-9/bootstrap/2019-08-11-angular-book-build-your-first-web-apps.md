This book teaches modern application development with Angular 2 and Angular 4. It begins with the basics of Angular and the technologies and techniques used throughout the book, such as key features of TypeScript, newer ES6 syntax and concepts, and details about the tools needed to write professional Angular applications.

The reader will next build an Angular application from scratch while learning about the primary pieces of an Angular application and see how they work together. Using lots of examples, the core parts of Angular will be introduced, such as Components, the Router, and Services.

The book also covers techniques like server-side rendering and how to incrementally add Angular 2+ features to existing AngularJS applications. Finally, the reader will gain insight into advanced skills that should be part of any professional Angular developerâ€™s toolkit such as testing, tooling options, and performance tuning.
