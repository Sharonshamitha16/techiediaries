In this post, we'll learn how to send an Http POST request with Angular 9 HttpClient to a Node/Express server for authenticating users.

## Adding Angular 9 Authentication Forms for Sending Post Requests

In the previous [tutorial](https://www.techiediaries.com/angular-tutorial-forms-authentication-expressjs/), we've created authentication (login and register) forms with Angular 9/8 and a REST API server for handing authentication with Node and Express.js.

We've created the `Login` and `Register` components with the necessary forms to collect the user's credentials (name, email and password) and display them on the browser's console. 

## Posting User Credentials to a Node Authentication Server with Angular 9 HttpClient

In this tutorial, we'll add the code for actually submitting user's information to the authentication server via a POST request in order to register or authenticate the user. 

This is the screenshot of the registration component:

 This is the screenshot of the login component:
    
![Angular 9 form - login example](https://www.diigo.com/file/image/bbccosoazescdcsdadzdqdabdbr/Frontend.jpg)

When you click on the login and register buttons, the values your entered on the form will be only displayed on the console but in actual web applications these values need to be sent to the authentication server (in our case it's a Node and Express.js server that's running locally on the `http://localhost:3000 address`).

## Sending a POST Request with Angular 9 HttpClient

Let's change that! 

Basically what you need to do it to change the `register()` and `signIn()` methods to send an HTTP POST request to the authentication server with Angular `HttpClient`. 

But, we are not going to call the Angular `HttpClient` methods directly from the `register()` and `login()` methods because that's usually considered bad practice in Angular. Instead we'll create an Angular 9 service that encapsulates all the communication with the Node authentication server. 

In nutshell, these are the steps that we are going to follow throughout this tutorial:

- First, we need to setup `HttpClient` in our Angular 9 project (exactly in our `auth` module),
- Next, we generate an `AuthService` and we implement methods such as `signIn()`, `register()` and `signOut()` etc.
- Finally, we inject `AuthService` in out `Login` and `Register` components and we call the appropriates service methods to register and authenticate users.

So let's get started!

## Prerequisites

As a prerequisite, this tutorial assumes you have followed the previous tutorial where we have created the authentication server with Node and Express.js and created the Angular 9 project with the necessary modules and components.

## Setting up Angular 9 `HttpClient`

Previously we've created the `auth` module. This module encapsulate the authentication logic in our Angular 9 application. Let's import `HttpClient` in this module. 

Open the `src/app/auth/auth.module.ts` file and add the following changes:

```ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';

import { AuthRoutingModule } from './auth-routing.module';
import { RegisterComponent } from './register/register.component';
import { LoginComponent } from './login/login.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [RegisterComponent, LoginComponent],
  imports: [
    CommonModule,
    FormsModule,
    HttpClientModule,
    AuthRoutingModule
  ]
})
export class AuthModule { }
```

We simply import `HttpClientModule` from `@angular/common/http` and we add it in the `imports` array of `AuthModule`.

That's it! You are ready to send HTTP POST requests in your application.

## Creating `AuthService` and Injecting `HttpClient`

Next, let's create an Angular service that's responsible for sending authentication POST requests to the backend server.

In your terminal, navigate to your Angular 9 project's root folder and run the following command:

```bash
$ ng generate service auth/auth
```

> **Note**: We add the `auth/` path before the name of our service (which is also `auth`) to make the service a part of the `auth` module.

The command will generate two `src/app/auth/auth.service.spec.ts` and `src/app/auth/auth.service.ts` files. 

### Importing Angular 9 HttpClient

Open the `src/app/auth/auth.service.ts` file, import `HttpClient` and inject it via the service's constructor:

```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AuthService {
  constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) { }
}
```  

## Implementing the Authentication Methods

After creating the `AuthService` and injecting `HttpClient` let's now create the methods of the service i.e the `register()`, `signIn()`, `signOut()` and `isAuthenticated()` methods. The `register()` and `signIn()` methods work by sending POST requests to the `/register` and `/login` endpoints of the backend server with the user's credentials. The server will process the POST requests and create or authenticate the user.

### Adding `User` and `JWTResponse` Model(s)

We'll be using two models:

- The `User` model that encapsulates information about a user such as name, email and password.
- The `JWTResponse` model that encapsulates information about the returned JWT response from the server which contains the JWT access token, the expiration date and the user's information used to create the token.

In your terminal, run the following commands to generate the `User` and `JWTResponse` models:

```bash
$ ng generate interface auth/user
$ ng generate interface auth/jwt-response
```
 
 Open the  `src/app/auth/user.ts` file and update as follows:

```ts
export interface User {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    password: string;
}
```

Open the `src/app/auth/jwt-response.ts` file and update as follows:

```ts
export interface JwtResponse {
    user: {
        id: number,
        name: string,
        email: string,
        access_token: string,
        expires_in: number
    }
}
```

Next, open the `src/app/auth/auth.service.ts` file and import the two models:

```ts
import { User } from  './user';
import { JwtResponse } from  './jwt-response';
```

Also, import `Observable`, `BehaviorSubject` and `tap()`

```ts
import { tap } from  'rxjs/operators';
import { Observable, BehaviorSubject } from  'rxjs';
```

Next add a variable that holds the address of the authentication server:

```ts
AUTH_SERVER = "http://localhost:3000";
```

Finally, add a `authSubject` variable of type `BehaviorSubject` with initial value of false:

```ts
authSubject  =  new  BehaviorSubject(false);
```

This variable tracks the [user's authentication state](https://www.techiediaries.com/angular/ui-guards-auto-scrolling-filereader-ionic/). `false` means the user is not authenticated yet.

### Adding the `register()` method: Sending a POST Request with  `HttpClient`

Let's start with the implementation of the `register()` method. Open the `src/app/auth/auth.service.ts` file and add:

```ts
  register(user: User): Observable<JwtResponse> {
    return this.httpClient.post<JwtResponse>(`${this.AUTH_SERVER}/register`, user).pipe(
      tap((res:  JwtResponse ) => {

        if (res.user) {
          localStorage.set("ACCESS_TOKEN", res.user.access_token);
          localStorage.set("EXPIRES_IN", res.user.expires_in);
          this.authSubject.next(true);
        }
      })

    );
  }
```

### Adding the `signIn()` Method: Sending a POST Request with  `HttpClient`

Next, add the `signIn()` method:

```ts
  singIn(user: User): Observable<JwtResponse> {
    return this.httpClient.post(`${this.AUTH_SERVER}/login`, user).pipe(
      tap(async (res: JwtResponse) => {

        if (res.user) {
          localStorage.setItem("ACCESS_TOKEN", res.user.access_token);
          localStorage.setItem("EXPIRES_IN", res.user.expires_in);
          this.authSubject.next(true);
        }
      })
    );
  }
```    

### Adding the `signOut()` Method: Removing the JWT Token from Local Storage

Next, let's implement the `signOut()` method:

```ts
  signOut() {
    localStorage.removeItem("ACCESS_TOKEN");
    localStorage.removeItem("EXPIRES_IN");
    this.authSubject.next(false);
  }
``` 

### Adding the `isAuthenticated()` Method: Returning the `authSubject` as Observable

```ts
isAuthenticated() {
	return  this.authSubject.asObservable();
}
```

## Calling `AuthService` Methods in The Angular 9 Components

After fully implementing `AuthService`, let's now call these methods in the `Login` and `Register` components.

Open the `src/app/auth/login.component.ts` file and update it as follows: 


```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Router } from '@angular/router';
import { AuthService } from '../auth.service';
import { User } from '../user';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-register',
  templateUrl: './register.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./register.component.css']
})
export class RegisterComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor(private authService: AuthService, private router: Router) { }

  ngOnInit() {}

  register(form) {
    console.log(form.value);
    this.authService.register(form.value).subscribe((res) => {
      this.router.navigateByUrl('home');
    });
  }
}
```

First we import `AuthService` and `Router` and we inject them via the component's constructor. Next, we call the `register()` method of `AuthService` and we pass in the form value. 

Next, open the `src/app/auth/register.component.ts` file and update it as follows: 

```ts
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { Router } from '@angular/router';

import { AuthService } from '../auth.service';
import { User } from '../user';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-login',
  templateUrl: './login.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./login.component.css']
})
export class LoginComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor(private authService: AuthService, private router: Router) { }

  ngOnInit() {
  }

  login(form){
    console.log(form.value);
    this.authService.signIn(form.value).subscribe((res)=>{
      console.log("Logged in!");
      this.router.navigateByUrl('home');
    });    
  }

}
```

Again, we import and inject `AuthService` and `Router` via the component's constructor then in the login() method we call the `signIn()` method of `AuthService` to authenticate the user.

In both the `login()` and `register()` methods we subscribe to the returned Observable and we use the Router `navigateByUrl()` method to navigate to a home page so you should also create a home page and map it to the `home` route.

Please note that we don't do any error checking here. Subscribing to the Observable doesn't guarantee that we get a successful response all the time so you should also do some basic error checking before navigating to the home page.
