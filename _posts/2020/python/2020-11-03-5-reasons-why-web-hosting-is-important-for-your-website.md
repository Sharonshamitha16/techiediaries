As more and more businesses are taking the digital approach, there’s an influx of more and more websites on the internet. Having a good website helps you to garner online traffic and generate business revenue.

However, not everyone who sets up an online platform succeeds in cracking the digital code. Many businesses fail due to poor website functionality and bad user experience. A website’s usability lies on three pillars – a good web design, search engine optimization and a solid web hosting. Mere purchasing a domain name won’t do it. You need to have a web hosting account or hire a web hosting company that will ensure that your website is visible to people on the internet.

How does web hosting work?

When you create your online portal, a hosting service places all of its files on a server. The web host provides this space for you to store your website on the internet. At the start, you share a networking space on the server. Then as your needs increase in terms of internet storage space, you can then opt for a separate space on the server for your portal. The web hosting provider handles this storage space for you, ensuring the successful accessibility of your website on the internet.

When users type your domain name on their web browser, their computer connects to the server your website is hosted on. Then that server sends the files that are up for display, to the user on their browser.

There are primarily two kinds of web hosting solutions. One is free service and the other is premium paid service. The free service is free for its end user and is heavily powered by advertisements. On the other hand, paid service is far more reliable and safe in the long run and provides far greater flexibility in terms of storage for handling heavy online traffic. Understandably, the free hosting solutions provider will fill the need for your personal blog or non-commercial website.

Reasons why web hosting is important for your website:

##  1) Safe and stable server environment

Choosing a good web host provider is paramount if you want a secure server to rest your website on. Only a safe web host can provide a network space that is strong enough to fight online threats, hacks and other cyber-attacks. A reliable web host provider will keep your site data and client’s personal data safe.

## 2)  Data storage

The amount of data that needs to be stored on your website’s server plays a huge role in deciding what kind of web hosting partner you’re looking for. How much online traffic your website can handle, including concurrent users needs to be well established before you make a deal with a hosting service. Putting a limit to storage can lead to site shutdown when traffic is high on your webpage. A premium web host, like [Hosting Foundry](https://hostingfoundry.com/), will provide you with a variety of options depending on your data limit and fulfill your hosting needs.

## 3)  Reliable customer service

High quality customer service is a hallmark of a good web hosting solutions provider. A good web host will always be there when you need any kind of technical assistance or support. It can offer multiple ways for you to contact them whenever the need arises for you to do so.

## 4)  Speed

One of the main reasons for bad user experience is slow loading times of your website’s landing page. A poor web host capability will see a lot of site crashes due to too much load on the shared server. This will lead to your clients looking for hosting services elsewhere where there are tools and software strong enough to top lags and heavier traffic.

## 5)  Customizable pricing

It is very important that once you’ve chosen your web host provider, you opt for a flexible plan which can be modified based on the site’s needs. If your website grows over time, then your web host should cater to the increased server, storage, data speed demands without much fuss. A free plan, on the contrary, is likely to be full of non-negotiable terms that won’t come in handy when you need high performance.

## Conclusion

A trustworthy web host solutions provider is a must for your website as it will ensure that your website runs smoothly and does not buckle under pressures of high bandwidth. Keep the above points in mind while you search for a suitable web hosting provider.
