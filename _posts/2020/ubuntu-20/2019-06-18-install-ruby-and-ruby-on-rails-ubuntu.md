In this tutorial, we'll see how we can install the latest version of Ruby v2.6 on Ubuntu 20.04 Disco Dingo. and next we'll see how to set up a development environment for Ruby on Rails 6.

As of this writing, the current stable version of Ruby is **v2.6.3**.

## How to Install Ruby 2.6 on Ubuntu 20.04?

You can install Ruby 2.6 on Ubuntu 20.04 using three different methods:

- Using `rbenv`
- Using RVM or Ruby Version Manager
- From the source 

So let's use `rbenv`.

## Installing Ruby 2.6 with `rbenv`

You first need to install `rbenv` and then use it to install Ruby v2.6.

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
```

We simply clone `rbenv` GitHub repository into the `~/.rbenv` folder. 

You need to have Git installed on your system. If not, simply run `sudo apt install git` from your command line.

Next, run the following commands to set up `rbenv`:

```bash
$ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
$ exec $SHELL
```
 
 Next, you need to download the [ruby-build](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build) plugin into the `plugins` folder of `rbenv` as follows:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git "$(rbenv root)"/plugins/ruby-build
```

The `ruby-build` plugin adds the `install` command to `rbenv`.

> **Note**: You can also install `rbenv` and `ruby-build` using the `sudo apt-get install rbenv ruby-build` command.

Finally, you can install Ruby 2.6.3 using the following command:

```bash
$ rbenv install 2.6.3
$ rbenv global 2.6.3
```

This is the output in the terminal:

```bash
Downloading ruby-2.6.3.tar.bz2...
-> https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/2.6/ruby-2.6.3.tar.bz2
Installing ruby-2.6.3...
Installed ruby-2.6.3 to /home/<user_name>/.rbenv/versions/2.6.3
```

If your installation fails, make sure you install the `libreadline-dev` and `zlib1g-dev` dependencies:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev
```

You can check out your Ruby version using the following command:

```bash
$ ruby -v
```

Next, you need to install `bundler` with `gem`:

```bash
$ gem install bundler
```

This will install `bundler` **v2.0.2**.

After installing `bundler`, you need to run:

```bash
$ rbenv rehash
``` 

## Installing Ruby on Rails 6 on Ubuntu 20.04

After installing Ruby 2.6, let's now see how we can install Ruby on Rails 6.

As of this writing, Rails 6.0.0.rc1 is released. Let's see how to install it. Open a new terminal and run the following command:

```bash
$ gem install rails -v 6.0.0.rc1
```

Next, run the following command to make the rails executable available:

```bash
$ rbenv rehash
```

That's it! You can verify your installed Rails version by running the following command:

```bash
$ rails -v
# Rails 6.0.0.rc1
```

Congratulations! You have set up your development environment for Ruby on Rails 6 development.
