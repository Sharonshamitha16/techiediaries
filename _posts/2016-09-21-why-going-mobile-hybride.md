![Ionic Hybrid Development](/images/content/why-going-mobile-hybride/bigimage.png)


I like Android platform and like to develop with Java especially for Android. 

After finishing development, you'll have at the end a nice mobile app, with a native feel and look, for Android phones and/or tablets, but no more! Well you can say that's what you need! And you are right. 

Just take a breath and think about it for a little while.

**You are missing an important percentage of the mobile market**


Yes that's right! You may have many reasons to target a bigger audience, maybe your client wants more customers to find out about their mobile app so they can achieve more sales, or maybe you want a bigger income from your app so you need at least to target one more platform if not more than one. 

The most obvious choice after Android is iOS so if you want your app to be available for this platform users too you need to deal with Swift and iOS SDK or you'll have to hire a developer who has these skills. 

You'll have two apps, each one with its own budget, and two code bases to maintain which will not be an easy task at all. 

Now if convinced. Is there a solution? Yes; welcome to hybride mobile development.

## What is hybride mobile development and what it can do 

 Simply a hybride mobile development is about creating mobile applications with web technologies - JavaScript,CSS and HTML - Instead of native platform languages such as Java for Android and Swift for iOS.  
 
 You can develop your mobile app as a web app and even test it on the web browser and then wrap it with a container (Like Cordova) to behave like any native app and to access device functionalities which a normal web app can't access. 
 
What benefits you get from hybride development? Well at least now you have just one code base (for all platforms you target) which will reduce the complexity of developing for more than on platform, reduces your costs - You don't need more than one developer for the same app. And in case you are developing the app yourself,you don't need to deal with different development environments or to learn different SDKs, different APIs and different languages.

If you happen to be a web developer then you can use your already acquired skills to develop mobile apps.

We are writing this article to help you see why going hybride for your next mobile app is a really good choice either if you are someone looking to have a mobile app for a business or a mobile apps developer who develops apps for himself or for his clients. Also this  aims to show you how to begin hybride mobile development.

## The state of hybrid mobile apps in 2019

Back to 2010 when hybride mobile apps start to show up and hybride mobile development begins as a new area in development world ,hybride apps  were not what users expect or used to use,they were buggy and lacked performance with huge seeable difference from native apps.So people took a ,But be happy it's time to get rid of those old thoughts about hybride mobile ,this is not 2011 it's 2016 and things have significantly changed from what was before,web browsers become more powerful,web standards and languages evolved,new frameworks with modern features emerged,mobile devices are more than twice powerful, performance is no more an issue,you'll hardly notice any difference in performance between a native and hybride app .You'll rarely need a native app instead of hybrid app except for some cases which i even can't think of them right now.So why the hell you need a native app instead of a hybride if you can reduce your costs ,easily maintain your code base and in the same time get nearly the same performance and the same look and feel ?!

## Frameworks of the Hybrid Mobile


Before starting hybrid development you need to decide which framework you need to use .That's not a very easy decision to make ,there are a lot of frameworks with a lot of similarities and a lot of differences(costs,learning curves,community,programming language etc..) but you need to pickup one so let me help you.I introduce you one framework that rules them all ,It's Ionic ,it is based on Cordova(native container) and uses Angular.js (the powerful and popular client side javascript framework developed by Google).This mix makes Ionic one of the most popular and most used hybride mobile framework among developers.

## Why Ionic 4

As I said Ionic mixes the popular native container Apache Cordova for accessing native device functionality (Needed by mobile apps) with Angular.js ,HTML5 and CSS .It will cost you nothing ,it's free .

Ionic also has a great community of developers around it ,a great team behind it development and a lot of related [projects](http://ngcordova.com/) which can help you achieve more when using the framework.

So with Ionic you can use Angular.js(JavaScript) ,HTML and CSS to build your hybrid mobile apps that look and feel like native apps and do the same things native apps do(Thanks to Cordova) while targeting either Android and iOS (recently Windows Phone too) with a unique and shared code base.

Recently the Ionic team started to develop Ionic 2 (Now on beta) a completely rewritten framework based on Angular 2 which brings even more performance and features to hybrid mobile development and uses a modern language ,TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript.Don't be afraid of TypeScript it's just a superset of JavaScript(version 2015 or Ecmascript 6) plus types.



## Conclusion

This is the first part of why going hybride, see you in the next part in which we are going to continue learning how to build apps with Ionic 4.
