A web proxy is a site which provides you access to any site in the web,it simply makes the request on behalf of you ,when you normally visit a website your browser sends the request to the web server ,in the case when using a web proxy ,your browser makes the request to the proxy server,the proxy makes the request to the target website and then gives you back the response after  receiving it from the target.

As you may know ,there exists many benefits of using a web proxy ,the most obvious one is hiding your identity from the server you intend to visit, because you never connect to it, directly ,the web proxy performs the actual connexion and gives you back  the response.In this way your ip address is hidden from the site you are visiting.It is  of course known by the web proxy but that is not  a problem because you are trying to hide from the other site not the proxy.

Lot of people use proxies to visit sites blocked by their governments ,organizations or to bypass filters used by companies they are working for,to prevent them from accessing some websites at work like Facebook,Youtube or any entertainment site.

Proxies can be also used to bypass parental control or firewalls,they can be used in universities or schools which are known to block social and entertainment websites.

So in general a proxy is a server or software system that sits between two parts wishing to connect,the proxy in this case acts as an intermediary between clients looking for some resource and servers.

In summary the most obvious reasons to use a proxy are :

Anonymity:Hide your ip address and protect your online privacy
--------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------

For some people being anonymous ,when browsing the web or using Internet , is a priority and that is for many strong reasons ,but a also its is a personal choice ,web proxies provide easy anonymity without using sophisticated tools,so anyone can use it to protect his online privacy and hides its ip address from others.

Caching: for the purpose of speeding up access
-----------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------

Caching is the process of storing resources at many levels ,for the sake of speeding up access ,so for example a proxy can be used  to store web pages delivered by servers at some long distance from clients of a country or a city , so when they demand access to some web site the proxy delivers the cached version instead of directly connecting with the distant server,this is done for the sake of speeding up access to clients,this kind of proxies are usually installed by Internet service provider.

Access:Either prevent or allow access
-------------------------------------
------------------------------------

As we stated above ,a proxy can be used by people to unblock or get access to some blocked sites but also may be used by some parties such as companies to block access to some sites by using a proxy server to tunnel all connections coming in or getting out of a company network ,so they can control and filters the desired traffic allowed to pass to their network.

Conclusion
--------------
----------------

A proxy has many other benefits ,but for the average Internet user,when he is talking about a proxy, then there is a big chance that he is talking about some sort of a web proxy used to get access to blocked web sites either in his country,his home,school or company etc.
