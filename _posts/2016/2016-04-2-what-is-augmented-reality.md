What is Augmented Reality ?
Tom Caudell ,a researcher in Boeing was the first one to use the term 'Augmented Reality'   in an attempt to describe  a digital display used by aircraft engineers made by mixing some graphics with a physical reality .In computer science Augmented Reality is mixing computer graphics and sound within a real world context in realtime time with interaction i.e the real world constructs and virtual computer constructs can interact with each other .the real world reality is recorded  using a camera and microphone ,the computer in realtime adds virtual reality constructs and take care of any interaction between the two worlds ,the computer uses complicated algorithms of augmented reality and computer graphics to make it possible .

Enrich user context using computer graphics and sound.

Virtual Reality vs Augmented Reality 



How to Augment The Reality:

Grab Camera Input.

Analyze camera video feed to get locations of AR Markers .

Add virtual constructs and display the result in real time



Location based vs Marker based Augmented Reality

What's Computer Vision ?

Face Detection and recognition

Object tracking

 How to get a computer to see  ? camera input +object detection and recognition algorithms.

 Tracking.js 

https://trackingjs.com/ 

An open source JavaScript library for tracking algorithms

lets build a small project using tracking.js and gif.js:how to use your camera and Tracking.js to create GIF images

First request the camera input from the user ,if the user grants you persmission you can access his camera feed

navigator.getUserMedia ...

use video tag and canvas to get pixel matrix of each video image

use tracking.js to track the user's face and add virtual things in or obove the face(fire above,barb etc.. )

record the gif image of video and save it 



What is OpenCV ?
