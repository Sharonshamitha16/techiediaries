Hello there,this is my first  tutorial to teach developers  how to make 2d art for games,these tutorials target mainly game developers but can be also followed by anyone interested in making 2d art with inkscape.
In this tutorial i will show you how to make trees using many techniques ,precisely 3 differents techniques i use all the time to make trees.

The first one technique is a bit harder because it requires some artistic skills and yet it gives less realistic trees,we will draw some shapes and tweak them to get a  tree 

The second and the third technique uses fractals and L-systems to produce some very realistic trees ,if you don’t know what are fractals and L-systems ,read about them in my blog i will put the address below or just search Google for the two terms,

I'm assuming you are familiar with Inkscape basics but you can follow this tutorial even if you don’t ,many tools in Inkscape are self describing ,now let is begin with the first technique :

Select the draw freehand lines tool or just hit F6 in the keyboard

Make sure you have the same settings I have ,in the Mode option choose create regular bezier path ,adjust the smoothing to 80 and choose Triangle in option in the Shape setting .

Ok if everything is ok try to draw a branch like curve ,feel free to experiment many times until you are satisfied with the result

Another method you can choose the draw bezier curve and straight lines tool (or hit F6 + Shift in the keyboard) and draw a triangle ,select Edit paths by nodes or hit F2 and tweak it a little bit to get a smooth branch like shape then choose a color for your branch (preferably green).

Now it is time to make a leaf so bring the draw bezier curve and straight lines tool(F6+Shif) and draw a leaf like shape (feel free to experiment many times) ,select Edit paths by nodes tool (F2) and tweak it to get more realistic leaf.

For the main trunk of the tree select  create rectangles and squares tool (or hit F4) ,draw a rectangle ,convert it to a path , use Edit paths by nodes and tweak it to get a more realistic trunk
