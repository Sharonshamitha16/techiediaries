AdBlock plus becomes mainstream and more people are using it to block advertisements from showing up .Big 
advertisement companies such as Google are paying them to white list their ads which are considered as 
not annoying . 

Many webmasters and bloggers get paid for their content creation by means of ads by joining programs 
such as Google Adsense or other similar networks .

Users running AdBlock prevent these publishers from getting earnings since Ads are not shown .

In this article we'll shed light at some used techniques to monetize AdBlock traffic a.k.a traffic coming 
from visitors that are using AdBlocker .

Strategy 1 : Prevent access to content 
-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------

You can very easily use a JavaScript code to detect users who are using AdBlock and if they are not willing 
to pay for the content ,at least by allowing ads then it's fair enough to prevent them access to your 
content ,everybody in the world has the right to get paid for his work .

Before implementing this startegy on your website ,make sure it is really what you want to do because 
even if you can't make money using Ads these visitors can spread your content and even make it popular by 
means of social shares providing it's quality shareable and informative content so they can help you bring 
more traffic that may pay you for your efforts.

Although it's your right to prevent access to your content for those people who don't want to pay you 
for the content your create and publish even without directly paying from their pockets .But also this 
strategy is a little bit aggressive .So instead taking this approach you may also consider another strategy
that may help you get better results 

Strategy 2 : Ask for donation 
-----------------------------------
-----------------------------------

Since you are creating quality and informative content for free ,you can gently ask your visitors who are blocking 
ads to either unblock or white list your website or donate some bucks in exchange of your efforts .Many 
websites are taking this approach ,you can even take it further  to offer subscriptions for quality content 
without ads .

If you really have informative and good quality content you won't find problems getting one of these three 
options i.e : 

Getting your website white listed .

Getting some donations  .

Getting paid subscriptions .

If somehow you are not finding any success following this strategy you may need to try the thir strategy 
which is serving ads again but this time a different kind of ads .

Strategy 3 :  Serving Native Ads to AdBlock traffic 
--------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------

If you are following with advertisement technologies then you may have heard of native ads served by 
content promotion networks such as RevContent ,Taboola ,AdNow etc .These kind of ads are served 
differently from classic ads ,and they are designed to look like website content ,so they are don't get 
blocked by AdBlocker .The majority of these networks don't serve good quality ads ,they are also best 
suited for viral websites not informative content blogs but there is an exception which AdRecover .

AdRecover serves ads to AdBlocker traffic so it's designed only for people who are using AdBlocker .

AdRecover is native advertisement network which is as good as popular networks such as Google AdSense .

But unlike Adsense ,AdRecover has a strict minimum page-views requirements which is 100,000 pageviews per day 
,not easily achievable for every blogger out there especially for new blogs .

So these are the different strategies used to monetize AdBlocker traffic .You need to know your audience 
better and then choose the right strategy that can bring you more earnings and pay for your efforts .
