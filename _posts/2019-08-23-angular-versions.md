In Software Development, apps are versioned by following [**Semantic Versioning**](https://semver.org/)**,** which is simply a convention that everyone starts to follow.

Angular also follows semantic versioning which has a **Major.Minor.Patch** format. We increment a specific section when there is a major, minor or patch release:

**Major Release** The Major part is incremented by one if the new features break backwards compatibility,
**Minor Release** The Minor part is incremented by one if the new features donâ€™t break any existing features,
**Patch Release**The Minor part is incremented by one 1 for releasing patch fixes.

The Angular team releases a new major version each six months and the last version, as of this time, is **Angular 8:**
