After Angular 6, Angular 7 beta is here. The Angular Team released Angular 7 beta.1 which brings many bug fixes and features.

## Angular 7 Features

Let's see the new features of Angular 7:

### DoBootstrap

Angular 7 added a new life-cycle hook (`ngDoBootstrap`) and interface (`DoBootstrap`). For example:

```ts
class AppModule implements DoBootstrap {
  ngDoBootstrap(appRef: ApplicationRef) {
    appRef.bootstrap(AppComponent);
  }
}
```

It's used for bootstrapping modules that need to bootstrap a component.

### The Angular Compatibility Compiler (ngcc)
 

Just like the name suggests, this compiler will be used to transform the `node_modules` compiled with the `ngc` to `node_modules` which are compatible with the new **Ivy renderer**.


### Better Error Handling


Also Angular 7 has an improved error handling for `@Output` if property is not initialized.
