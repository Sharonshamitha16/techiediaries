I have struggled for a past period of time from a bad Laptop .As a normal user my Laptop was quite 
enough for a lot of things I do,such as browsing the web ,watching videos and playing some popular games etc .
But as a developer it was far from what I really needed which has negatively impacted my productivity and 
added some extra complexity to my daily tasks .Depending on the kind of a developer you are ,you might 
think that I'm exaggerating .Especially if you are a web developer who is still using the old tools to build simple 
static or portfolio websites or even web apps .In this case any Laptop can be quite enough for you ,but not at all ,if you are the kind of 
developer who tend to use modern tools and frameworks .Think of it ,for example a cross platform mobile developer 
using modern frameworks such as Ionic ,NativeScript or React Native ,needs to use emulators or even virtual machines for different 
mobile devices .It is more productive than having to debug on different real devices .Also Development IDEs 
are becoming more powerful but in the same time consume more processor power and memory resources ,a lot of 
them have even raised their minimum hardware requirements. 

Aside from development tools ,we can consider many other factors when choosing the right Laptop to buy which we can better 
define by answering these questions 

How often you develop ?

Are a freelancer or a digital nomad ?

Do you use a main Desktop development machine ?

Are you a mobile ,web developer or maybe an Indie game developer ? full stack developer  ? a cross platform developer ? etc .

By just answering these questions ,you can easily determine the factors you need to consider when buying a new Laptop 
for development ,such as the two always forgotten factors : Laptop battery life and Agronomy ,but also processor power , 
memory and you might even consider the hard drive capacity and Graphics card .

If you just think thoroughly about the factors you will come to the unavoidable conclusion ,you are a developer ,you need a powerful Laptop , 
by powerful I mean a combination of criteria from processor power ,memory ,hard drive capacity ,Graphic card,battery life and Agronomy .

Another thing to mention before heading to the list of best Laptops for developers to buy in 2017 ,is the operating system .
While MAC OS is considered the best operating system for designers ,Linux is the most developer friendly OS but even if these facts are true you still 
need Windows if you are developing apps for the Microsoft ecosystem ,Windows also has one of the best development IDEs in the 
world which is Visual Studio with power features such as Intellisense for code completion .

I don't pretend to have the best list of Laptop for developers ,I also don't pretend that I have tested all these Laptops 
myself .It's based on the opinions of some friend developers ,research on online communities and my educated opinion which 
you can yourself have if you have a good experience with development and different related tools using a Laptop computer .

So now ,lets look at the best Laptops for the year 2017 which are what developers need to buy for a better productivity and agronomy .

The list will be updated and new Laptops will be added as soon as I can get more information .

1 - Acer Aspire E5 : Best laptop for developers on a budget

Acer Aspire E5 is one of the best Laptops for developers who are on a budget .It is quite good for doing the everyday 
development tasks but also for gaming since it has a very decent set of features ,6th Generation Intel i5-6200U ,Nvidia GeForce 940 MX Graphics 
card ,8 GB of DDR4 memory and 256GB SSD .For the screen size it's 15.6 inch with a screen resolution of 1920x1080   

For the battery life ,it's quite good but it always depends on the tasks you are doing so when executing CPU extensive 
tasks such as compiling and building apps which is what developers do all the time ,you may definitely experience less battery life 
as it's promised by the seller which is around 9.5 hours for web surfing over WiFi or even up to 12-hours .
