If you've done it yet ,you should upgrate to version 3 of Ionic CLI which contains many changes and improvements
such as the install speed ,better help documentation and interactive commands so if you usually forget how 
to use the commands ,the new CLI will help you use them .

This upgrade will change the way you use the CLI because some commands have been removed and some other 
commands have been changed ,but it's really worth it . 

So to get started ,open you command prompt or terminal and type :
    
    npm uninstall -g ionic 
    
This will uninstall the current installed version of the Ionic CLI .

Next run the following to install Ionic CLI v3

    npm install -g ionic@latest

You need also to install the new CLI inside your current project if you are working on a project generated 
with the previous CLI version 

Inside an Ionic 1 project ,execute 

    npm install --save-dev @ionic/cli-plugin-ionic1@latest 
    npm install --save-dev @ionic/cli-plugin-cordova@latest

Inside an Ionic 2 / Ionic 3 ,execute

    npm install --save-dev @ionic/cli-plugin-ionic-angular@latest
    npm install --save-dev @ionic/cli-plugin-cordova@latest

<div class="note">
One of the improvments to Ionic CLI v3 is the best assistance when you are using commands either with a 
new project or an old existing project ,so if you have old projects generated by previous versions of the 
Ionic CLI ,just go ahead and try to serve them and don't worry the CLI will detect the changes and prompt 
you to install the necessary dependencies .
<br>
For example if you run ionic serve with an old existing project ,the CLI will propts you to install 
<em> @ionic/cli-plugin-ionic-angular </em> and you just have to answer YES .Also when you need to use 
ionic cordova command ,the CLI will prompt you to install <em>@ionic/cli-plugin-cordova</em> plugin .
</div>


After installing the Ionic CLI v3 ,you can verify the versions of installed components by running 

    ionic info 

I'm getting :    

    global packages:

        @ionic/cli-utils : 1.0.0
        Ionic CLI        : 3.0.0

    System:

        Node       : v7.9.0
        OS         : Linux 4.2
        Xcode      : not installed
        ios-deploy : not installed
        ios-sim    : not installed

Generating a new project with Ionic CLI v3
-----------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------

Lets use the new CLI to generate a new Ionic  project .GO ahead and run 

    ionic start hellocli3 blank 

When the CLI finishes ,navigate inside the project and run ionic info 

    cd hellocli3
    ionic info 

You should get something like 

    global packages:

        @ionic/cli-utils : 1.0.0
        Cordova CLI      : 6.5.0 
        Ionic CLI        : 3.0.0

    local packages:

        @ionic/app-scripts              : 1.3.7
        @ionic/cli-plugin-cordova       : 1.0.0
        @ionic/cli-plugin-ionic-angular : 1.0.0
        Ionic Framework                 : ionic-angular 3.2.1

    System:

        Node       : v7.9.0
        OS         : Linux 4.2
        Xcode      : not installed
        ios-deploy : not installed
        ios-sim    : not installed
        
<div class="note">

You can also type just ionic start and let the CLI assists by asking you other info about the project 
you are creating and then generate one for you .
<br>
As you can see ,you don't need to specify the old switch --v2 anymore
