Thanks to Electron you can use modern web technologies ,tools and frameworks to build cross platform apps for Desktop targeting major operating systems Windows ,Linux and MAC.

You can also use the great Node.js based build tools such as Grunt and Gulp to automate development tasks such as scaffolding ,running ,testing and packaging your apps built with Electron .

In this post we are going to see another tool which uses best modern JavaScript build tools to offer an all in one tool which you can use to quickly scaffold a new project based on Electron and also run ,test and finally build and package your app for distribution without having to switch between a multitude of existing tools which you can’t even remember .

The tool is Bozon .It makes use of many existing tools such as
