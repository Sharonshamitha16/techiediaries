Hello and welcome to my  tutorial series designed to teach developers some simple techniques to use for drawing decent 2d game art without being professional 2d artists.I'm myself a developer and I'm using these simple techniques to create pretty and decent 2d art for my games.

I will teach you how to draw elements we usually need in 2d games, such as 

2D trees,

2D mountains,

2D rocks,

2D homes and game characters etc.

Using the free and open source great tool Inkscape.

First of all,I will start by giving you an introduction to Inkscape and some useful tools inside this program,which I use with simple techniques to draw some decent and sometimes complex 2d art ,and then i will show you some of the works i've made with Inkscape and we will try to reproduce it in these tutorials ,so let's start:

Getting started with Inkscape:
-----------------------------

We are going to break this part into 6 sections.

The first section is about a brief introduction to Inkscape .

The second section is about  briefly exploring the inkscape user interface.

The third section  talks about maths for inkscape !

The fourth section shows you some of the 2d art made using inkscape and some simple techniques .

The fifth section talks about inkscape layers,what are used for and how to use them  ?

the sixth section is a small conclusion to what we have seen till now.

So lets get started

Introduction to Inkscape:
-----------------------
------------------------

So hello and welcome to the first section,which introduces Inkscape.Inkscape is a free and open source tool for drawing 2d vector art ,which is a powerful free alternative to the well known, commercial and industry leader vector drawing tool, illustrator or the also well known CorelDraw.Inkscape is a cross platform program,available for Windows,MAC and Linux.

You can use Inkscape to do any 2d drawing for 2d games,such as 2d characters or environmental elements like trees or mountains, it can be used also for many different tasks like web designing ,banner and visit cards creation etc.

Inkscape is an SVG tool ,SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, which is, as its name suggests, a scalable 2d graphic format,that's different from the classical bitmap formats such as  PNG or GIF ,because produced art can be scaled up or down, without affecting their resolution.

Once you’ve produced your art with Inkscape, you can save it as SVG file and you can also export it to classical image formats such as PNG.

Using SVG tools for drawing art makes it dead simple to support many resolutions and platforms ,you can without much effort export sprites for multiple device resolutions.

Before we dive in Inkscape,i will show you some of my work using this free tool and  some easy to follow techniques ,if you like it then follow with me in these tutorials to learn how to produce this kind of 2d art without being an artist .

Now let’s move on to the second section,which is about the Inkscape user interface.

Exploring the Inkscape user interface
--------------------------------------
--------------------------------------

OK as you can see,on the top of Inkscape ,you can find many menus,some of them are classical menus you can find in many programs,such as the File menu which contains among other commands,the New,Open,Save,Export, Import and Properties commands.

use the New command to open a new blank inkscape page ,you can choose from many formats according to your needs, Default, A4,icon 32x32 ,for the purpose of our tutorials just choose the Default one.

The Second Menu is Edit ,which is also found in many programs,which contains among others  cut(Control + X),copy(Control + C), paste(Control + V) and duplicate(Control + D)  and Delete commands.

Next to Edit there is View menu which has many commands that can be used to anything related to the view like duplicating the Window , Switch On and Off the Fullscreen mode,Grids,Pixel Snapping,Showing and hiding some interface elements. 

Next to the View Menu sits the the Layer menu ,use the commands in this menu to create and work with layers ,like adding,duplicating,deleting,renaming and changing the z-index of layers,if you are used to work with tools like Photoshop the same concept of layers apply to inkscape.

A layer is a logical grouping of elements ,we will talk about layers later.

Next to Layer sits the Object menu which has commands to use for clipping,masking,patterns and one of the most useful Inkscape command, Group and its related command Ungroup ,the group command is used to group many objects as one object,and apply operations on all of them  as one object ,and you can ungroup anytime you want.the transform command is also useful and contains transform operations such as scaling,rotating,moving,skewing and direct transform matrix manipulation.

Next to Object menu sits the Path menu which contains the commands I always use for the techniques I follow to draw 2d art,like the Union,the Intersection and the other commands.

Next to Path menu there is Text Menu which contains text related commands.

Next to Text menu exists Filters Menu which contains many filters to apply to your art for different effects.

Next to Filters existes the extensions Menu which contains a list of all extensions available .

Next to Extensions Menu exists the Help menu which contains inkscape help and documentation. 

At the right hand side exists the tools toolbar which contains drawing related commands,

That's all for this section of the tutorial now lets talk about maths in Inkscape ,don't worry that's not hard at all ,yet you need to understand these basic maths concepts so you can work with Inkscape and reproduce good 2d art by just leveraging them.
