Building a website with Jekyll has many advantages,beside having a good quality and free hosting with GitHub pages or GitLab:

You'll have more control on your website if you just know HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

You can easilly deploy your website and later your changes via simple Git commands

		 git add .

		 git commit -mm "update"

		 git push

Your website is composed of a bunch of HTML files ,all is static which means you'll have more security and blazing fast page load.

You don't have to deal with any complex server side technologies or databases .

That's awesome but as a side effect of having no server side you'll miss some features that the majority of websites need ,say for example,among many other functionality ,contact forms.If you want your visitors to be able to contact you then you need to add a contact form to your website ,so what you can do in such a case ?

In this tutorial i'm going to show how to add a contact form for your Jekyll website or any static website without having to build a server side application .

The solution is really easy, if you can't or don't want to build a server side app then you just need to use a saas service which offers form submission,data storage and retrieve ,the most popular serviice is Google forms but also there many other providers
