In this tutorial, we'll be introducing JWT tokens for Angular developers and we'll also build a simple example demo with Angular 8.

We'll first start by answering these fundamental questions about JWT to grasp the theory behind it:

- What is JWT Authentication?
- How is JWT Pronounced?
- What is JWT Secret?
- How Does JWT Authentication Works?
- How Long Should JWT Tokens Last?
- Is JWT Secure?
- Are JSON Web Tokens Secure?
- What is The Difference between JWT and OAuth?
- How do I Check my JWT Token?
- How do JWT Tokens Expire?

Let's gets started!

## What is JWT Authentication?

JWT Authentication is a form of authentication in commonly use in modern REST-based web applications in which we have a clear sepration of the client and server tiers. It makes use of JSON tokens to authenticate users before allowing them access to protected resources.

>JWTs are an encoded representation of a JSON object. The JSON object consists of zero or more name/value pairs, where the names are strings and the values are arbitrary JSON values. JWT is useful to send such information in the clear (for example in an URL) while it can still be trusted to be unreadable (i.e. encrypted), unmodifiable (i.e. signed) and url-safe (i.e. Base64 encoded).

>JWTs can have different usages: authentication mechanism, url-safe encoding, securely sharing private data, interoperability, data expiration, etc. Regardless of how you will use your JWT, the mechanisms to construct and verify it are the same.

Check out the [JWT specification](http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html) for more information.
