The Bounce rate metric is one of the most misunderstood concepts in Google Analytics.

But actually it's a simple concept to understand ,yet it's a very expressive metric .Basically it tells you about how your visitors 
act when they first land on your website i.e they do browse ,other pages ,further more or just leave ?

To be much precise ,the more accurate definition is :

A Bounce rate is the percentage (%) of single page sessions or visits .

Lets further explain it :

A bounce rate expresses the count of visits (sessions) in which a visitor leaves your website right from 
the landing page where he first entered ,without browsing other pages on the website .

This metric frighten most webmasters when it's high ,but it really shouldn't do , because of the way it's interpreted .

You know each Google Analytics metric has to be interpreted somehow to really get an idea of what's 
happening with your website ? and if that's good or bad for your goals ,earnings ,conversions or sales etc .  

If you first read the definition of Bounce rate then you'll interpret it as how much interest your visitors 
have for your website .

A high bounce rate can be interpreted as :

Most visitors leave right from where they have landed ,they didn't browse any other page(s) so maybe they 
didn't find interesting information or motivation to continue browsing .Well that maybe correct ,that's one interpretation but 
how about :

They have actually found what they were looking for ,and they don't need to browse more pages so they just 
leave .   

So depending on the type of website ,is it an informational blog ? or an ecommerce website or maybe a 
technical website ,you should interpret bounce rates .

In an ecommerce website where you are selling a product ,a high bounce rate should be worrying because it 
means that your landing pages or your website enterance pages are not relevant to your your visitors but that's 
not also a rigid rule ,what if a visitor converts with a single page session ,does this high bounce rate 
be considered as bad ? of course No ! 

For informational websites or problem solving websites such as forums ,for  geeks ,think about StackOverflow 
most of the time the user uses a search engine like Google to look precisly for some information and since 
Search Engines become smart and can do their job perfectly ,they just land your on the correct page .In this 
case visitors just leave from the enterance page which result in a high bounce rate .That's not a bad thing 
but it can also indicates that your pages are written in such a way that motivates vistors to browser pages .

Bounce rate is a good metric which tells you about the quality of your traffic but it should be interpreted 
diffrently and depending on your website type and your goals .
