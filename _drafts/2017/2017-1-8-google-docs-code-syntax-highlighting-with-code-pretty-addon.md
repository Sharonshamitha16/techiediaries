In this quick post ,i’ll share with you a very useful tip which is going to make writing code snippets inside Google docs fun and easy if you use Google docs for any technical writings .

Since I’m an avid  user of Google docs I use it to write all my docs even the posts for my websites which include snippets of code a lot of time so I needed a way to add support for code syntax highlighting  to make my docs clear and more readable ,especially when they contain a lot of codes .

So here is how you can add support for code syntax highlighting inside your Google docs .

First you need to install Code Pretty addon ,so go ahead open up Google Docs at [docs.google.com](http://docs.google.com) then create a new doc .

Next go to Add-ons menu

{% include image.html
   img="images/content/google-docs-code-syntax-highlighting-with-code-pretty-addon/add-ons-menu.png"
       title="Google docs code syntax highlighting with Code Pretty addon"
%} 

Then click on Get add-ons...

{% include image.html
   img="images/content/google-docs-code-syntax-highlighting-with-code-pretty-addon/get-add-ons-menu.png"
       title="Google docs code syntax highlighting with Code Pretty addon"
%} 

A window will popup ,on the search box enter “code pretty”

{% include image.html
   img="images/content/google-docs-code-syntax-highlighting-with-code-pretty-addon/search-for-code-pretty.png"
       title="Google docs code syntax highlighting with Code Pretty addon"
%} 

And hit enter ,you should get your results

   img="images/content/google-docs-code-syntax-highlighting-with-code-pretty-addon/result-code-pretty.png"
       title="Google docs code syntax highlighting with Code Pretty addon"
%} 

Click on + free button .You will be redirected to a window for requesting permissions 

{% include image.html
   img="images/content/google-docs-code-syntax-highlighting-with-code-pretty-addon/permissions-code-pretty.png"
       title="Google docs code syntax highlighting with Code Pretty addon"
%}

Click on Allow .
Your addon will be added to your Google docs 

{% include image.html
   img="images/content/google-docs-code-syntax-highlighting-with-code-pretty-addon/use-code-pretty.png"
       title="Google docs code syntax highlighting with Code Pretty addon"
%}

Now to use Code Pretty you need to select the code you want to format and highlight then go to your Code Pretty menu and select Format Selection 

{% include image.html
   img="images/content/google-docs-code-syntax-highlighting-with-code-pretty-addon/format-selection-code-pretty.png"
       title="Google docs code syntax highlighting with Code Pretty addon"
%}

Here is a code snippet before and after using Format Selection

       title="Google docs code syntax highlighting with Code Pretty addon"
%}
{% include image.html
   img="images/content/google-docs-code-syntax-highlighting-with-code-pretty-addon/after-code-pretty.png"
       title="Google docs code syntax highlighting with Code Pretty addon"
%}

## Conclusion
