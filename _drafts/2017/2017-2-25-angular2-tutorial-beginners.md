## Angular 6 Overview - what is Angular 2?

Angular 6 is an open source client side framework for building web desktop and mobile apps with a component based approach. It is built and maintained by Google.

Angular 6 is the latest version of Angular, it was rewritten from scratch with TypeScript language which is a super set of JavaScript built by Microsoft, TypeScript is a modern OOP (Object Oriented Programing) language and unlike JavaScriptit is strongly typed which adds more security and readability.

Unlike Angular 1, Angular 6 is component based framework which simply means that your app needs to be 
considered or perceived as a set of components with a parent and root component which bootstraps the application.

Angular 6 can be used by JavaScript, Dart or TypeScript. The recommended language to use is TypeScript but you are freeto use any language you prefer.
