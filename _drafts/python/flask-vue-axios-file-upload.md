# Flask RESTful Single & Multiple File Upload with Vue.js, Axios and FormData 

In this tutorial, we'll be learning how to build an example application that implements single and multiple file upload in Flask. We'll also be using Vue.js in the front-end.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial has a few requisites such as:

- Python 3 and pip installed on your development machine,
- Working knowledge of Flask and Vue.js

## Creating a Virtual Environment and Installing Flask

Let's get started by creating and activating  a virtual environment for isolating the packages for the current project.  Open a new terminal, navigate to your working folder and run the following commands:

```bash
$ cd ~/demos
$ python3 -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
```

Next, let's install Flask using pip:

```bash
$ pip install flask
```
