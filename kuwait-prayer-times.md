Kuwait Prayer Times tries to be the first app that brings muslims (Shia and sunna) in Kuwait and worldwide accurate pray times for the daily five prayers and other times such as sunrise, sunset and imsak time which is most important in Ramadan.

I, the developer, invested time and resources to create a new app with new design and good performance for the three platforms i.e the web, desktop and mobile. for web and mobile web the app uses new PWA technologies to deliver the best app experience to users around the world, for desktop the app uses new web technologies to deliver a cross platform experience to muslim users in Kuwait and also around the world. The desktop app is available for Windows and Linux and soon will be availabe for MAC operating system.  

The app uses some advanced mathematical methods to calculate accurate pray times relative to user's city geo coordinates.
There are various methods for calculating pray times. You can set the calculation method used in your county through app's settings.

The app initially tries to determine geolocation coordinates through the HTML5 Geolocation API and if it fails it requires the user to enter his city latitude and longitude once when the app starts then save them locally and use them everytime the app is launched without requiring users to enter them each time.

The app uses settings for prayer times in Kuwait (SUNNA) by default but if you live outside of Kuwait or you want calculations to be made according to Shia rules then you can use the app settings to change nearly any setting which controls pray times calculations.

Kuwait & Worldwide (Sunna & Shia) Prayer Times App is free of charge and you can use the preferred version for you, the online version is responsive which means it can be used for the desktop and mobile web and since it is a PWA (Progressive Web App) it's optimized to run on 2G and 3G networks with good performance.  

Kuwait & Worldwide Pray Times uses Al-Ojairi calender which is considered to be the official calendar in the state of Kuwait and other middle east and north Africa Arabic countries. 

### Kuwait & Worldwide Prayer Times Settings

You can configure your app to calculate exacte prayers times for your city or geo-location by providing some app-wide settings such as:

* Latitude and logitude: these can also be determined automatically using HTML5 Geolocation API.
* Time Zone: this can also be determined automatically from the operating system.
* DST: Datelight Saving Time, can also be retrieved from the system settings.
* The Calculation method: such as the Muslim World league.

You can set one of these calculation methods, depending on your country official method. For Kuwait the app is using Makkah method for Sunnah prayer times and Jafari method for Shia prayer times.

* MWL	Muslim World League
* ISNA	Islamic Society of North America
* Egypt	Egyptian General Authority of Survey
* Makkah	Umm al-Qura University, Makkah
* Karachi	University of Islamic Sciences, Karachi
* Tehran	Institute of Geophysics, University of Tehran
* Jafari	Shia Ithna Ashari (Ja`fari)


### Setting ASR Methods 

Asr prayer time can be calculated more accurately by tweaking its related settings, there are two methods for calculating Asr pray times:

* Standard: this setting is used for most Islamic schools such as Shafii, Maliki, Jafari and Hanbali (set shadow factor to 1)
* Hanafi: just like the name suggests, this setting is used for	Hanafi school or madhab (set shadow factor to 2)

## Setting the Midnight Calculation Method

For midnight time, there are also some differences between different schools on how to calculate the exact time so depending on your country and your official adopted school of thoughts you can set one of these values:

* Standard: this method simply uses	the mean time from Sunset to Sunrise
* Jafari: this one uses	the mean time from Maghrib to Fajr

## Setting Adhan and Alarms

The app's developer will soon add an option for setting Adhan voices and alarms sounds so whenever comes time for a prayer, the user will be hearing either an adhan voice or an alarming sound.   

### Printing Pray Time-Tables for Kuwait and World Countries
