Throughout this tutorial series and learning path you'll learn Angular--the most popular platform for building front-end web applications 

Using Angular, you can take advantage of a powerful TypeScript platform and tools to create applications for web, mobile and desktop. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript with powerful OOP abstracts and a strongly typed system that compiles to JavaScript.

With Angular you have strong tools and design patterns to build either small or large web projects. 


Angular is developed and maintained by Google. It has a large community which means you can find help on the web if you have any issues implementing your project requirements.

Our Angular learning path will offer the necessary tutorials, PDF books, for beginners, and examples to get started using this framework in your next project.
