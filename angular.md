# Angular 9/8/7/6 Learning Path

Throughout this tutorial series and learning path you'll learn Angular--the most popular platform for building front-end web applications 

Using Angular, you can take advantage of a powerful TypeScript platform and tools to create applications for web, mobile and desktop. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript with powerful OOP abstracts and a strongly typed system that compiles to JavaScript.

With Angular you have strong tools and design patterns to build either small or large web projects. 


Angular is developed and maintained by Google. It has a large community which means you can find help on the web if you have any issues implementing your project requirements.

Our Angular learning path will offer the necessary tutorials, PDF books, for beginners, and examples to get started using this framework in your next project.

How do you start learning Angular?

Angular is not like React, it's a complete platform which includes all what you need to build frontend web apps, so learning it will take you more time. Let's make the process easy for you by providing you with a roadmap.

If you are a beginner frontend web developer, you probably want to start by learning the basics of frontend web development i.e what we call the three pillars of the web, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You don't need to master these technologies but you should be familiar with the basics and build simple web pages with HTML, style them with CSS and add interactivity with JavaScript.

You can get started with HTML, JavaScript and CSS from our guides:

- <a href="https://www.techiediaries.com/html-tutorial/">HTML Tutorial for Angular developers</a>: Angular makes use of regular HTML with an extra template syntax so in this article, we'll introduce you to HTML from an Angular point of vue.
- <a href="https://www.techiediaries.com/css-tutorial/">HTML Tutorial for Angular developers</a>: We'll also introduce to CSS and we'll see in the same time how you can start using it in the context of Angular.

Angular makes use of TypeScript instead of plain JavaScript. TypeScript is a super-set of JavaScript that adds object oriented concepts and strong types to the language but before you can run your code in a web browser, you will need to compile it to JavaScript. We'll see later that this is pre-configured for you in your Angular project.

These are some JavaScript guides in our website:

And this is our TypeScript tutorial(s):
